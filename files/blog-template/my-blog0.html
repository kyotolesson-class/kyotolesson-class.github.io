        <p>To play this game, try to solve the problem in the black area. If you think the answer is "TRUE" choose TRUE. If you think the answer is "FALSE", choose FALSE.</p>

        <p>If you get an answer wrong, you get a red STRIKE ‚ùå</p>

        <p>If you answer 5 problems correctly, you go to the next level. When you level up, the problems get harder, but your strikes go back to zero.</p>

        <p>When I made this project, I learned many things. I learned how to randomly create problems using JavaScript. I also learned how to get the computer to determine whether the answer is correct or incorrect. It was a lot of fun!</p>

        <p>If I decide to work on this project more, I would make <code>functions</code> that the player needs to read to solve new, harder problems.</p>
