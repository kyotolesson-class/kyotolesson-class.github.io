* [Zoom version](#zoom-version)


## Teacher Says


We played a game whose purpose was to make sure everyone knew some basic vocabulary for user actions, and how to perform the actions. Since I expected to have to use this vocabulary often, I wanted to be sure the kids would know it. The rules were:
- If I say "Teacher Says" it means everyone does what I say.
- If I don't say "Teacher Says", no one does anything.
- If I don't say it, and you do it, you have to kneel for one turn.
- If I  say it, and you don't do it, you have to kneel for one turn.


## Zoom version

Now let's work on it again together. We are going to play the game [Teacher Says](../lessons/TeacherSays.html) like we did before but in this version, 

I will walk through the project.  As I go:

* I will describe **the next action**. 
* Watch my screen to see where the two icons are:

    1. One thumb up <span style="font-size:200%;">üëç</span>
    2. Two hands together <span style="font-size:200%;">üëè</span> 
* I will ask everyone or individuals to choose the correct answer. 
  
  - ONLY ANSWER IF I SAY TEACHER SAYS!!! 
  - If I say "teacher says, choose", answer. 
  - If I only say "choose", don't answer.

* When you answer, send the message for the icon which does **the next action**, either 1 üëç or 2 üëè. You can also just use your hands. I will wait until everyone has answered before giving the right answer, **so answer quickly**.


Pay attention because I may ask you at any time, and you need to know where I am.
