### Game: **"What you like"**

Send a private chats. Say what you like. For example: I like sushi. I like pink. You can do anything: games, movies, books, actors, singers, bands, songs, foods, flavors of ice cream, toothpaste flavors, whatever. I like...., or I hate.... IF the person you talk to agrees, you each get one point. How many points can you get? The more people you ask or answer to, the more points you get. In 3 minutes, we will see who has the most likes.

### Game: **Teacher Says, Zoom style**

I am going to send you each of a private message. You should do what I tell you to do, such as raise your hand, or give me a thumbs up, or clap. YOu do it. Then you pass it on to someone else. Example: I tell hikari to raise his hand. He does it.(we each get a point) Then he tells Alena to raise her hand. she does it. (You each get a point) When you get a point you tell me. Then She tells etc.

### Game: **Teacher Says, advanced version** 

This time message everyone. We can all see the chates. I tell you to tell someone to do something. They do it. Then that person tells someone else to tell someone to do something. etc. We can see who asked and who did.

* E.g. I tell Hikari to raise his hand. If he does it, I will give you each a point. 
* You can help each other. 
* The last person sends another person a message to tell someone to do something. 
* If that person does it, everyone in the chain gets a point! 
* Who can get the most points! I will be be counting...I hope I can count right
