## Review anti-corona measures

* temps and washing hands
* don't touch
* sit apart

## Confirm and Set up Discord.

Students can:

* open app
* log in 
* hear and see teacher
* see the teacher's screen

* can see whiteboard

## Black

We play a game called Black. The game is fun, and it turns out it creates a maze we can use for ScratchJr.

- [] Print boards for the game/provide pen and paper

## Maze Demo

I will demonstrate how to make a character have to gather jewels before being able to exit a maze. At this point this may be demonstration only, and we will develop the coding in steps.

This involves understanding:

* characters visible/invisible blocks
* sending message blocks
* contact trigger block


## Review Homework: Making a Maze

Go through steps of making a maze again and make sure everyone knows how to:

* use grid
* draw straight lines
* add figures
* use start trigger
* use movement blocks
* record sounds
* make characters speak


## Scratching Black

We will now code the Black Mazes. Focus is on:

* Planning before you code 
* Visualizing your outcome
* Converting your plan into code 
* Using the grid carefully


## characters visible/invisible blocks

Set up characters 1-4 who disappear: 

1. At the start
2. At the start, After they walk 5 steps 
3. At the start, after singing a song in their favorite language
4. If they are touched by another character


## sending message blocks

Make the characters above send messages to other characters after they disappear:

At start:
1->2: Character 1 walks 10 steps and makes character 2 reappear say i am back and dance,  then disappears.
3->4: Character 3 walks in a circle, says HELP, sings a song,  makes character 4 fly then disappears.

## contact trigger block

When Character 4 flies, she hits the ceiling, making all the characters reappear. She returns to her home.

## Homework

* As applicable. 
* Play Black with your parents or sibling or friends. What did they think?
