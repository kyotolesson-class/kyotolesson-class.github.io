*Students learn hands-on how to make a wide variety of computer games: platform games, role-playing games, adventure games, puzzle games, and many more -- the limit is their imagination!*

## ScratchJr.

After some preliminaries introducing the goals of the class, the first coding projects we introduce are based on a program called [Scratch Jr.](https://www.scratchjr.org/about/info). Created by Tufts University, MIT and the Playful Invention Company, this platform teaches basic computing using simple blocks that control animated figures. In addition to the curriculum and projects offered on the [Bootup website](https://bootuppd.org/curriculum), we develop our own projects based on student interests and capabilities. 


### Mazes

Scratch is simple enough to use that one can easily generate interesting projects. As an example of projects we develop in ScratchJr., two line mazes are simple but rewarding projects that give time for students to become comfortable with the graphical user interface and the basic blocks. The "Square with Holes" maze is very easy to draw, and yet adds more challenges. Creating it further develops their computer drawing skills, and brings in elements of precise movement control and logical sequencing. Lastly, we move onto the linear path maze, using the popular Dragon Maze. This incorporates gaming, logic, and user interaction that are essential elements of modern coding.

### Developmental Growth

Though the main focus is coding, language and other developmental skills are an integral part of what we do. For example, logic games such as Black and language games such as perennial favorite Hangman are natural complement to straightforward coding.

Communication skills are developed both in how children create projects around stories, holidays, and language play, and in how children are taught to learn about and express themselves and work with others. Celebrating diversity and individual growth and development is integral part of our program.

Open-ended group projects like "Teamwork 5000" develop leadership and cooperation skills, as well as creativity and imagination. Projects like the Halloween Project and A Day in the Life help celebrate children's individual experiences and cultural backgrounds. Retelling favorite stories like the Hare and the Tortoise, or Knock Knock Jokes develop storytelling and other language skills. Message Mania is a project primarily foocused on teaching how to send messages, but in fun and unpredictable ways. This helps students think about complexity, intereconnectedness, and other aspects that take on greater meaning as they develop coding experience. 

## Scratch and Tynker



Eventually, children reach the stage where we can introduce them to larger and more powerful toolkits. One of these is called Scratch, which is the big brother to ScratchJr. The other is called Tynker, which starts with the underlying Scratch block set, but adds components that allow for platformer and topdown games like Mario Kart and so on. These are both very powerful, and are flexible enough where the only limit is the child's imagination. 

Classes usually involve a mix of instructor provided projects where primary concepts are introduced and reviewed and individual projects that students develop on their own over time.  For example, a recent class demonstrates the diversity of projects we end up working on:

A Family Story
  : A student told a story based on a family trip involving creating actors, costumes, and conversations to tell a story about adopting pets.

Magic The Gathering
  : One student drew inspiration from the popular card game Magic the Gathering and attempted to imagine how that could be transformed into a Tynker project. This led to learning about to use functions to develop repeatable programming structures.
  
Pong 
  : One student remixed a Pong game and discovered a bug: The game didn't stop even when the player lost. With a little help, the student was able to debug it.

Platform Game
  : One student is designing a single shooter Platform Game. He discovered on his own an undocumented feature where you can shoot larger bullets by holding the key down. The student then worked on improving the placement of their actors.

## Class Requirements


ScratchJr. requires a tablet computer, as well as installation of the free ScratchJr. app. for iPad: [![App Store](./images/Apple_appstore.svg){: .appimage}](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/scratchjr/id895485086?ls=1&amp;mt=8) or android: [![Google Play](./images/GooglePlay.svg){: .appimage}](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.scratchjr.android)

Scratch and Tynker are web-based; for our purposes we require a laptop computer with a keyboard and mouse. In addition, to create a consistent interface among students, we recommend that Google Chrome be installed as the browser.
