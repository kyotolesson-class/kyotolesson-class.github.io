Keep doing that until the cat goes to the right place.

## Review of Behavior


As I mentioned recently, the kids became a bit energetic last week for a while. To help reset the class time, I started the class with a review of some basic guidelines. We focused on ways to limit distractions, and what to do (and not do) when you are waiting for the teacher to get to you. We talked about staying in your seat, and talking quietly and respectfully to create a good learning environment. 


### Motion Exercises

Some students worked on the first motion exercise. Some students are using new computers and are still getting used to the "interface", so it was sometimes slow. They were able to finish the exercise anyway, and I will continue to work individually with the students to get used the interface.

### Controlling characters depending on a choice.

Some students started working on mazes, and a question about how to make a random number control an action:

```
when this sprite clicked
set [var] to (pick random (0) to (1))
if <(var) > (.5)> then
broadcast (option 1 v)
else 
broadcast (option 2 v)
end
```
{: .msb}


### An easy mouse game

Another student came up with this great game idea on their own:

```
when @greenFlag clicked
forever
    go to [random position v]
    wait (1) seconds
end

when this sprite clicked
start sound [Magic Spell v]
next costume
```

An easy and fun game.

## Sharing Projects 

We talked a little about how to share projects with **Studios**, and we shared links to studios so people could follow each other. In the end I found a better way to do this, and I have manually makde everyone follow each other on Scratch, and so it will be easy to share projects from now on. I will explain more about this next week.
