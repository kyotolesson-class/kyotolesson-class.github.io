## Homework for October 5th

THe homework for October 5th is to continue working the tutorials in [this folder](https://scratch.mit.edu/studios/27602759/). 

Slightly more detailed instructions, as kids are still having trouble navigating the website:

Click the link. You should see something like:

The goal of the exercise is to choose the right block at right to put in at left. You can see hint and instructions in this video:

Keep doing that until the cat goes to the right place.

## Review of Behavior


As I mentioned recently, the kids became a bit energetic last week for a while. To help reset the class time, I started the class with a review of some basic guidelines. We focused on ways to limit distractions, and what to do when you are waiting for the teacher to get to you. 


---

During class there is often a time when we are working on our own project. At these times, try to limit conversation. Talking when you don't need to can make it hard for others (and you) to concentrate.

If kids have a question but I am busy, for example taking care of another student, here are a few good options for you while you are waiting:

* try to figure out the answer yourself
* work on another project
* create another project to show off what you can do!
* ask another student (quietly) for help
* look at other projects
* be patient
* think about what you would like to do after you get the answer
* Think about what project you would like to create next

** It is OK to remind me from time to time that you are waiting, but doing it too often is rude to others.

Some things that are not OK in that situation:

* Don't use the internet or your computer for things unrelated to classwork. No Youtube, and so on.
* Don't disturb other kids, even if they might enjoy it.
** Loud and physical play is fun, but it is also possibly dangerous and can bother and distract other students. There are times and places where it is OK, but this class is not an appropriate place for it.

Some people do not like to be touched in certain ways, so always be careful when touching another person or their stuff. In addition, right now touching others is not safe due to the coronavirus. Ask first!

Don't share food!!

Stay in your seat as much as possible or move carefully and quietly if you need to (i.e. to go to the restroom, for example).


This is a learning environment. Sometimes we talk about other things. Casual conversation is OK.

However, conversations that don't add to a fun positive learning environment are not OK. This means things like loud distracting conversations, hurtful words, and so on. A little silliness is fun, too much is distracting.

If I draw your attention to any of these things, try to correct your behavior.

Keep your speech positive and relevant.
Keep your hands to yourself.
Keep your focus on learning and creating.



### Motion Exercises

Some students worked on the first motion exercise. Some students are using new computers and are still getting used to the "interface", so it was sometimes slow. They were able to finish the exercise anyway, and I will continue to work indiviudually with the students to get used the interface.

### Controlling characters depending on a choice.

There was a question about how to make a random number control an action:

```
when this sprite clicked
set [var] to (pick random (0) to (1))
if <(var) > (.5)> then
broadcast (option 1 v)
else 
broadcast (option 2 v)
end
```
{: .msb}


### An easy mouse game

One student came up with this project:

```
when @greenFlag clicked
forever
    go to [random position v]
    wait (1) seconds
end

when this sprite clicked
start sound [Magic Spell v]
next costume
```
{: .msb}

An easy and fun game.

## Sharing Projects 

We talked a little about how to share projects with **Studios**, and we shared links to studios so people could follow each other. In the end I found a better way to do this, and I have manually makde everyone follow each other on Scratch, and so it will be easy to share projects from now on. I will explain more about this next week.
