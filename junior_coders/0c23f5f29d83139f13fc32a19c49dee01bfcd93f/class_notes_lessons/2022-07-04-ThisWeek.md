### Recap for July 1st

Scratch Jr.
  : Student A made a game about 2 cats fighting each other  

  : Student S maze project: we made a dragon maze game. , using messages to hide another character  
  

Scratch
  : Student Y continued working on generating random armor. He added more costumes and the appropriate code in parts of the costume but still has some parts to finish.


  : Student K worked on cleaning up his projeect by renaming sprites. I worked with him to learn how to add code from a text template.
  
  
  : Student M worked very hard this week. To create the second room (the family mart) in his project, we first renamed the original mybocks and then created similar myblocks for the second room (the classroom). He has a few more steps before the second room is working.

### Recap for July 4th
Today we did quite a lot. One goal was to finish making the meteor hit the kitty. We also talked about how to create dynamic backgrounds for the game.

Beforehand, though, we talked about myblocks, and I walked through and example of breaking "getting a glass of milk" down into steps, each a myblock, and then each of those steps has substeps, the content of the myblock.

We then used this concept to add a myblock that finds if we are touching the kitty, and make the kitty jump, and reduces the score.

We also learned how to find gifs for backgrounds, how to import gifs into our projects, and how to make the gifs play in Scratch.
