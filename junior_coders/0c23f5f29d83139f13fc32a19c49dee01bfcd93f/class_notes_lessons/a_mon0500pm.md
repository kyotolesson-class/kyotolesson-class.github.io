We had a little quiz as kids labeled various points on a graph, which the kids did great with. We then made the kitty go back up to the bottom when it reaches the bottom of the screen, using an if conditional. Then we made the kitty swing from side to side using the point in direction block. To complete the game trajectory, we made the sky number change after changing the position. Lastly we began to make a countdown, which we will finish next week." %}

Today Students H, J, and T worked on the Parachute Kitty. The steps involved were many, but everyone managed to get though the first stage. The first step was to create kitty, stars and clouds and a ground. Using clones we created several stars at random places. We also began making the sky change as we fall. 

{% include zakviewer.html Name="2022-04-18 Kitten Parachute! Week 1" ID="https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/675191253" caption="Rubric:

- Broadcast Initialize and wait
- Add initialize code (hide all)

- Broadcast start

      - GROUND: change sky# (+ initialize)
      - CLOUD: show cloud random, initialize round 
      - STARS: create stars with clones

Student H1 fixed a bug in this program that prevented his character from going backwards (de to a duplicated script). In addition , he created a health variable and made the character loose health when the bullet hits him.

{% include imgur.html title="" ID="https://i.imgur.com/l3cbKud.png" caption="She had to use several concepts today that seemed new or relatively for her. For example, she learned how to use the ask and answer blocks to get user input. She wasn't sure how to take her draft and turn it into an 'if then else' statement, and then I showed her how to create the 'answer = ~' conditional. She as very excited to learn how to duplicate blocks. When we tested her original code, she saw that the 'try again' message only appeared one time. I suggested a 'repeat until block' might help her solve that problem and she quickly realized its potential. I showed her a trick so that the first time the message says 'Type in my code' but if needed the loop repeats with a 'Try again' message until the right answer is provided. Next week she plans to make a parachute game with another student." width="" height="" spacer="" %}

### Recap for March 7th
 

Today we started with a simple exercise to demonstrate the concept of Events and actions. I went around the room and we created a project where each person would add one event/action pair.  Then I emphasized that each pair becomes a set of blocks in the project.

Our story was: 

1. When the green flag is clicked, The word "Game" and a character appear on teh screen.
2. When we press the character, he dances.
3. When he finishes dancing, sharks fly out of the sky and the word game disappears
4. When they are near the ground, they explode 
5. After they explode, the character dies.
6. After that a duck with a person on it pop on the screen.
7. They swim away.
8. When they are gone, the entire earth appears and everyone (on the earth) becomes Dwayne "the Rock" Johnson.

{% include zakviewer.html Name="2022-03-08 Man Shark Duck Rock on Scratch" ID="https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/655915522/" caption="" %}

Having done that, the students worked on their projects. Most began making their first sprites, as usual by either by getting them from the internet or drawwing them, removing backgrounds, modifying them, which I helped them do. 

Some reached the point where they were coding their projects as well, and most everyone seemed on track:

Today the class began a new Project Cycle/Contest. We reinforced expectations for class time and looked at the parts of Project Checklist/Storyboard for the Cycle.

{% include zakviewer.html Name="2022-02-27 2022 02 Project Cycle Challenges on Scratch" ID="https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/650291488/" caption="We reviewed the the full project cycle. First we discussed the Cycle Grading Scheme. Next we see how class time will be structured in the Cycle. This is only a slight modification of our current scheme. We
then reviewed the Project Checklist/Storyboard." %}

We made titles and talked about the goals of our projects. Then we looked at some example [Storyboards](./../lessons/Storyboards.html), and the students started making Storyboards.

* Goals, and Stoyboards

{% include niceimage-galleryNoTableweserveGifsNoLink.html folder="/images/2022-02-28/" %}

The homework for next week is to think about the storyboard for your project. This is a crucial step and we will work on it again next week.

Minecraft Travel Game 
  : Today we started a new class project. It is based on a version of Minecraft that I wrote. 

{% include zakviewer.html Name="2022-02-01 Minecraft Travel game V1" ID="https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/633644256/" caption="The object of the game is to get the player across the screen using only the given blocks." %}

So far we have done  : 

* Making a tile. This involves using the shift key to keep the tile square and careful sizing so the block is 15x15 pixels. We also make sure the costume is centered. 
* Making a head, body, leg, and arm. This uses the same skills. The arm costume has to be rotated to point forward.
* Using the point to cursor block to make the head and arm point to the mouse.
* Using a forever loop and go to and change y blocks to position the body, head, and arm securely. We talked about how much to change y depends on the size of the characters. 

```
when I receive [start round v]
forever
    go to [body v]    
    change y by ((10) + (12.5))
    point towards [mouse-pointer v] 
end
```
