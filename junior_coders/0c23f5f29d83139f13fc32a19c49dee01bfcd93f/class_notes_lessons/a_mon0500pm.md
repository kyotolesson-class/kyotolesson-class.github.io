## October 16th

This was a makeup class for one student. She worked on making a game in Tynker based on this Mario Kart Project: 

<iframe src="https://forkphorus.github.io/embed.html?id=420456768&auto-start=false&light-content=false" width="482" height="393" allowfullscreen="true" allowtransparency="true" style="border:none;"></iframe>
{: .jsgif}


The student made a lot of progress and learned many skills, including:

* Creating a actor using the character studio
  * Animating the actor
  * Make them appear to walk by using a loop
  * Making sure the actor walks only so far with the repeat until block
  * testing for the position with the > condition block
  * adjusting the speed by setting the wait


![](https://i.imgur.com/IWdAKfE.jpg)

* Having a title screen pop down 
  * Using the image editor to create the text
  * Hiding the actor at start 
  * Waiting, then showing the character 
  * Move the actor into position


![](https://i.imgur.com/OXTVEub.jpg)

* Adding Music 
  * Adding a background to the stage
  * using a forever loop
  * adding sounds using the gear icon

### Homework for October 19th

The homework for October 19th is:

* Complete the Tynker project or tutorial you are working on. 
* Also, the [Magical Pen Basic Tutorial](https://www.tynker.com/dashboard/student/#/my-classes/). You can start it before class at home, but we will finish it in class.

### Moving to Tynker

Today we introduced Tynker. 

In Tynker the class information and homework is kept on the [classroom page](https://www.tynker.com/dashboard/student/#/my-classes/) or [here](https://www.tynker.com/dashboard/student/#panelCompleted). There are some tutorials (optional) at the top, and the weekly/class assignments are at the bottom. 
 
![](https://i.imgur.com/gaqktsi.jpg)
{: .jsgif}


Some kids did a great job on the tutorials this week. Other kids focused on [different projects on the community board](https://www.tynker.com/dashboard/student/#/community). They thought about what kind of projects they would like to do and got used to the new interface. This Golf game is popular, and some kids are learning how to modify it.

{: .jsgif}

### The Tynker Class Page and Homework

Our next project is the *Magical Pen Basic Tutorial* at the bottom of the classroom ppage. You can get a head start on it if you want! Here is what the final project will look like (hover over the stage to see it work) when it if finished:

### Homework for October 12th

The homework for October 12th is to DRAFT your new project in scratch, without using scratch, on paper. This is a "thinking ahead" challenge.

Think about characters, objects, actions, scripts, etc.


### Simple Pong Game

Some students worked on the Pong Tutorial. The ball points in the 45 degree direction and keeps moving and bouncing off the edges


```
when gf clicked
point in direction (45)
forever 
move (15) steps
if on edge, bounce
end
```
{: .msb}

If it touches the paddle, it turns and keeps moving. 

```

when gf clicked
forever 
if <touching (paddle v) ?> then 
turn cw (180) degrees
move (15) steps
wait (0.5) seconds
end
end
```
{: .msb}


The paddle has to follow the mouse: 

```
when gf clicked
forever 
set x to (mouse x)
end
```
{: .msb}

The game stops if the wall is touched 

```
when gf clicked
forever 
if <touching (wall v) ?> then 
stop [all v]
end
end
```
{: .msb}

One next step is toa add sound...

```
if < > then 
play sound (1 v) until done :: music
end

```
{: .msb}


Also, adding a score element to the screen is nice{: .msb}
```


when gf clicked
set [Score v] to [0]

when gf clicked
forever 
if <touching (paddle v) ?> then 
change [Score v] by (1)
end
end

```
{: .msb}

### The Music Tutorial

Another students completed their own version of the music tutorial with a special button to start the music.

<iframe src="https://forkphorus.github.io/embed.html?id=432617711&auto-start=true&light-content=false" width="482" height="393" allowfullscreen="true" allowtransparency="true" style="border:none;"></iframe>

* see this in a new tab: [https://forkphorus.github.io/app.html?id=432617711
](https://forkphorus.github.io/app.html?id=432617711)


### A Remix 

Lastly, one student chose a different way of exploring; He started with a project he liked, and by tyring ot modify it learned how it worked. This was a great way to learn about tricks you might not have imagined. For example, we noticed this project has an intro screen that opens the first time the project is run, but not after that. It is a nice effect and depends on a clever, but simple, trick. Here's how it worked:

The key here is that the **firstOpen** flag is set to Yes before the project starts.  It is a lone block, not part 
of the regular execution, and so must be set manually. It will not be reset every time the program runs. 

```

set (firstOpen v) to [yes] 
```
{: .msb}

Then, because of the flag, it runs the intro:
```
when @greenFlag clicked
...
if <(firstOpen) = [yes]> then
    broadcast [intro v] and wait
ended

```
{: .msb}

When the intro is done, **firstOpen** is set to **no**
and stays that way on the next start (because it was manually set.)

```
when I receive [intro v]
do the intro
set [firstOpen v] to [no]
do more stuff
```
{: .msb}


Now that the student has learned it, he can use it in other projects.

The student tried to modify the project to add a tenth ball with his own "logo" on it. Designing the character was okay and making it appear was okay, but he found the ball wasn't doing anything. Why?? Because the code depends on creating 9 clones of one ball character, not separate ball characters. This is a technique we haven't learned yet. 

```
when @greenFlag clicked
erase all
ballColors::custom

define ballColors
...
repeat (9)
// this needs to be 10
    create clone of [myself v]
    next costume
    change x by (40)
end

```
{: .msb}

Because of this, the way to create a new ball starts with changing the 9 to a 10. But this still hasn't solved the problem completely. I wonder why? We will work on this next week!! Hint: it involves colors and lists!!

### Homework for October 5th

The homework for October 5th is to continue working the tutorials in [this folder](https://scratch.mit.edu/studios/27602759/). 

Slightly more detailed instructions, as kids are still having trouble navigating the website:

* Click the link. You should see something like:

![Motion Exercises](https://i.imgur.com/mnphvPD.jpg){: .jsgif}

* Be sure to login if you haven't...

![https://i.imgur.com/tNdXr7U.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/tNdXr7U.jpg){: width="50%" .jsgif}

* Click on the exercise you want to do, and you will see the project page. Click "Remix":

![Remix](https://i.imgur.com/ZowY8vN.jpg){: .jsgif}


* Exercise 2 looks like this. 

![Exercise 2](https://i.imgur.com/f3zYeOQ.jpg){: .jsgif}

The goal of the exercise is to choose the right block at right to put in at left. You have to choose the one that moves you to the right place. Notice the x and y values. You can see hint and instructions in this video:

  
[![Motion exercise 2](https://i.imgur.com/KZRfCfj.gif){: .jsgif} ](https://i.imgur.com/KZRfCfj.gif) 

* Keep adding new glide blocks that until the cat goes to the right place.  

Direct link to exercise 2: <https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/429161838/>. 

* This is what the answer will look like in the end (click the flag)

### Review of Behavior


As I mentioned recently, the kids became a bit energetic last week for a while. To help reset the class time, I started the class with a review of some basic guidelines. We focused on ways to limit distractions, and what to do (and not do) when you are waiting for the teacher to get to you. We talked about staying in your seat, and talking quietly and respectfully to create a good learning environment. 


### Motion Exercises

Some students worked on the first motion exercise. Some students are using new computers and are still getting used to the "interface", so it was sometimes slow. They were able to finish the exercise anyway, and I will continue to work individually with the students to help them get used the interface.

### Controlling characters depending on a choice.

Some students started working on mazes, and a question about how to make a random number control an action came up. Here is a hint. We can go over this next week:

```
when this sprite clicked
set [var] to (pick random (0) to (1))
if <(var) > (.5)> then
broadcast (option 1 v)
else 
broadcast (option 2 v)
end
```
{: .msb}


### An easy mouse game

Another student came up with this great game idea on their own:

```
when @greenFlag clicked
forever
    go to [random position v]
    wait (1) seconds
end

when this sprite clicked
start sound [Magic Spell v]
next costume
```
{: .msb}


<iframe src="https://forkphorus.github.io/embed.html?id=430118416&auto-start=true&light-content=false" width="482" height="393" allowfullscreen="true" allowtransparency="true" style="border:none;"></iframe>

An easy and fun game.

### Sharing Projects 

We talked a little about how to share projects with **Studios**, and we shared links to studios so people could follow each other. In the end I realized it was easier to have students follow each other directly, and I have manually make this happen. It will be easy to share projects from now on. I will explain more about this next week.

### Homework for September 28th and October 2nd

The homework is to: 

* keep working on projects you started.
* complete one or more Motion exercises here: <https://scratch.mit.edu/studios/27602759/>. 

The exercises have various sets of blocks. The goal is to put the blocks together in the right order so that they look as in the videos below.

#### Exercise 1

* Look at [this first](https://forkphorus.github.io/app.html?id=429155328), then 
* do the [exercise](https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/429158314/)

#### Exercise 2

* Look at [this first](https://forkphorus.github.io/app.html?id=429165733), then 
* do the [exercise](https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/429161838/)

#### Exercise 3

* Look at [this first](https://forkphorus.github.io/app.html?id=429167079), then 
* do the [exercise](https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/429173104/)

### Basic Motion Blocks

One student was being introduced to Scratch for the first time after using ScratchJR. The main goal was to help her get used to the new program "interface". She also did some basic tutorials and learned how to use the motion, play a sound, and change size blocks as follows. It was a lot for one day, but she did very well!

```
When this sprite clicked
move (100) steps
if on edge, bounce
set rotation style [left-right v] 

when this sprite clicked
play sound (1 v) until done

when this sprite clicked
repeat (15) 
change size by (10)
end
repeat (15) 
change size by (-10)
end
```
{: .msb}


### A more advanced student

A slightly more advanced student started with some tutorials, but added a lot of his own ideas.

<!-- <iframe src="https://forkphorus.github.io/embed.html?id=429283651&auto-start=true&light-content=false" width="482" height="393" allowfullscreen="true" allowtransparency="true" style="border:none;"></iframe> -->

* [open in new tab
](https://forkphorus.github.io/app.html?id=429283651)


 This project is wonderfully complex, with many great examples of "broadcasting". This is called sending messages in ScratchJr.

* making the character dance by changing the background, and then having this wonderful conversation:

```
// On the Dancer
when this sprite clicked
repeat (27) 
wait (1) seconds
next costume
end
broadcast (2 v)

// On the cat:

when i receive [2 v]
set voice to [kitten v] ::tts
speak [dude so cool] ::tts
broadcast (3 v)

// Dancer says thank you

when i receive [3 v] // small error in student project fixed here!
speak [thanks] ::tts
broadcast (5 v)

// Cat says you're welcome
when i receive [5 v]
speak [your welcome] ::tts
wait (5) seconds
speak [bye] ::tts
```
{: .msb}

* Using text to speech and starting the music

```
when this sprite clicked
set voice to [squeak v] ::tts //initialize
speak [I like to dance] ::tts
broadcast (1 v)


when I receive [1]
start sound [dance celebration] 
```
{: .msb}

* Buttons that send messages to change the music

```
// change background
when this sprite clicked
broadcast (7)

when I receive [7]
next backdrop
``` 
{: .msb}

* Using a variable to make the sounds change

This is especially difficult and I helped a bit. 

```
// initialize on dancer
when gf clicked
set [my variable v] to [0] // initialize

// on button click broadcast
when this sprite clicked
broadcast (8)

// on dancer receives broadcast
// and changes music
when i receive [8 v]
change [my variable v] by (1) // here we use the variable
stop all sounds
play sound (my variable v) until done // new variable -> new sound
```
{: .msb}



Altogether a great project.

### Next Week: Sept. 28th Homework

The homework is:

* Do one more tutorial
* Continue working on whatever projects you have started

### Crazy Pong Game

Today we focused on the Pong tutorial. We changed the background, and styled the ball and paddle.

<iframe src="https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/427629054/embed" allowtransparency="true" width="485" height="402" frameborder="0" scrolling="no" allowfullscreen></iframe>


The code also plays a sound if the ball touches the paddle.


```
when green flag clicked
forever
if on edge, bounce
move (15) steps
if <touching (Paddle v) ?> then
play sound (Boing v) until done
turn right (180) degrees
move (15) steps
end 
end 
```
{: .msb}


```
when green flag clicked
forever
if on edge, bounce
move (15) steps
if <touching (Paddle v) ?> then
play sound (Boing v) until done
turn right (180) degrees
move (15) steps
end 
end 
```


### Pong  Princess version

{% include giphy.html link="https://media.giphy.com/media/LKlYWuuvT8X8jNhK3K/" %} 


The ball moves at a diagonal, bouncing off the edges. It tells the the paddle (a princess!) when it has hit it.


```
when green flag clicked
point in direction (45)
forever
move (15) steps
if on edge, bounce
end 

when green flag clicked
forever
if <touching (Princess v) ?> then
broadcast (hit v)
turn cw (180) degrees
move (15) steps
end 
end
```
{: .msb}


```
when green flag clicked
point in direction (45)
forever
move (15) steps
if on edge, bounce
end 

when green flag clicked
forever
if <touching (Princess v) ?> then
broadcast (hit v)
turn cw (180) degrees
move (15) steps
end 
end
```

The paddle, in the form of a princess, follows the mouse with the set x to mouse x block. It also receives the message to speak.

```
when green flag clicked
forever
set x to (mouse x)
end 

when I receive [hit v]
say [Hello Crystal ] for (2) seconds
```
{: .msb}


```
when green flag clicked
forever
set x to (mouse x)
end 

when I receive [hit v]
say [Hello Crystal ] for (2) seconds
```

### Side to Side movement

Another project focused on adding many new characters. 

![](https://i.imgur.com/NBrGvHE.jpeg)

One character moves from side to side. It also knows how to bounce when it meets the dge. In addition, since it is going side to side, it wants a left-right rotation style (otherwise the character flips and comes back upside down),


```
when green flag clicked
set rotation style [left-right v]
forever
move (9) steps
if on edge, bounce
end
```
{: .msb}


```
when green flag clicked
set rotation style [left-right v]
forever
move (9) steps
if on edge, bounce
end
```

### Next week: Group Project to Review All Blocks 

The kids are very excited to start coding games and other advanced projects. Next week we will make a group project where the focus will be learning how each block works. We will focus on movement blocks, and all the blocks we have used so far. This will help up be able to think about what is possible in Scratch and design our own games!!

### September 14th Note to students: 

Today's class was a bit challenging. Everyone was very eager to explore new Scratch projects, but I understand and it was natural if you had the feeling that some things are a little hard still. Hang in there!! 

I really encourage you to try the tutorials before getting too far into your own big projects. Of course it is exciting that there are lots of fancy projects and games to make, but you have to walk before you can run. 

For me, the important thing is that everyone made a lot of progress individually in this class! You can be proud of what you did! These notes are to highlight and help you see the progress you made. 

Again, please try the tutorials!!! It really will help!

### Homework due Sept 21 

The homework is to:

* Review the class notes
* Finish the Animate My Name Tutorial  
* Keep working you whatever projects you started

### Do scratch tutorials

I started the class by asking kids look at and copy the [animate a name tutorial](https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/editor/?tutorial=all) tutorial. Here is a slow video walkthrough:

{% include youtubelazy.html  videoID="8mcwvngI98U" %}


Most kids were very eager to start their own projects, so I had them work on the tutorial and went around the room to hear their ideas for their individual projects (as int he homework) before they started working on them.

### Success 1: Birthday Cakes

One success was making a birthday song/cake project. The project had two goals:

1. Making birthday candles light and unlight
2. Clicking dots to make the music stop and start

#### Birthday Candles Go On and Off

Small Dot sprites on the radio act as buttons. When you click the buttons, they turn the music on and off.

The Cake sprite has 2 costumes.

![cake](https://i.imgur.com/a8WWROh.jpg)


The pink dot code makes the music play, and sends a message to the cake.  [](# "I corrected the student's project so the candles go out *after* the music plays."). The broadcast message block is just like the send message block in Scratch Jr., but more powerful.


```
when this sprite clicked
play sound (Birthday v) until done
broadcast (message1 v)
```
{: .msb}


```
when this sprite clicked
play sound (Birthday v) until done
broadcast (message1 v)
```

<!-- ![send message](https://i.imgur.com/thdqNMT.jpg) -->

When the cake gets the message, it changes costume. This make it seems the candles are going out.


```
when I receive [message1 v]
next costume
```
{: .msb}
<!-- ![get message](https://i.imgur.com/ctYUBO0.jpg) -->


```
when I receive [message1 v]
next costume
```

The red dot makes the music stop.


```
when this sprite clicked
stop all sounds
```
{: .msb}


```
when this sprite clicked
stop all sounds
```

<!-- ![stop music](https://i.imgur.com/IB9SwJh.jpg) -->

This is an excellent first project. Though you may have wanted to do more...it is a very good start. 

### Success 2: Cool Name animation

Letter sprites make the student's name appear sequentially. The key to this project is also using message blocks. On start, the letter sprites hide, wait, then each letter appears, waits, and **tells the next  sprite to appear**. 


```
when green flag clicked
hide
wait (1) seconds
show 
wait (1) seconds 
broadcast (appear sprite 2 v)
```
{: .msb}


```
when green flag clicked
hide
wait (1) seconds
show 
wait (1) seconds 
broadcast (appear sprite 2 v)
```

<!-- ![hide show broadcast](https://i.imgur.com/oF20zHM.jpg) -->

Continuing down the line, the sprites appear in sequence,


```
when green flag clicked
hide 

when I receive (appear sprite 2 v)
show 
wait (1) seconds 
broadcast (appear sprite 3 v)
```
{: .msb}


```
when green flag clicked
hide 

when I receive (appear sprite 2 v)
show 
wait (1) seconds 
broadcast (appear sprite 3 v)
```

<!-- ![start hide and when receive show  broadcast](https://i.imgur.com/Ic1XIle.jpg) -->

ending in a cool pair of **sunglasses** (my favorite touch!). 

![sunglasses](https://i.imgur.com/295we4t.jpg)


```
when green flag clicked
hide 

when I receive (appear letter last v)
show
```
{: .msb}


```
when green flag clicked
hide 

when I receive (appear letter last v)
show
```

<!-- ![hide show when receive](https://i.imgur.com/Zi1LNCL.jpg) -->

### Squiggly Line/Costumes Project

This emulated a more [advanced project](https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/418429641). Because of this, it was a bit tough, but they made a good start by using the "next costume" trick to change through a series of costumes. 


{% include giphy.html link="https://media.giphy.com/media/Q5dlB0kBckYD20Rgfl/" %} 

If you look at the original project this is exactly what it is, except repeated many times. The original project has 104 costumes!!

{% include giphy.html link="https://media.giphy.com/media/WsSDxggvsefJRAKLL3/" %}{: width="30%" height="400px"} 

<iframe src="https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/418429641/embed" allowtransparency="true" width="485" height="402" frameborder="0" scrolling="no" allowfullscreen></iframe>


These two are both great projects, and worth continuing!

### Success 3: Mario 

The king of all video games is of course Mario. Another student asked about how to make a character jump like Mario does. There is a simple way to **make Mario jump**:


```
when [up arrow v] key pressed
change y by (10)
wait (1) seconds
change y by (-10)
```
{: .msb}


```
when [up arrow v] key pressed
change y by (10)
wait (1) seconds
change y by (-10)
```


Of course there are more complicated ways that include moving forwards and gravity and other things, but as a beginning, this is a start.

Another important element of a Mario game is how to move the background. Using series of costumes this can look very smooth, but it takes a while to understand [how to do it](https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/76150/).

<iframe src="https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/76150/embed" allowtransparency="true" width="485" height="402" frameborder="0" scrolling="no" allowfullscreen></iframe>


### Success 4: The Fox Project

The Animate My Name tutorial seems very simple, it has a lot fo room for development. One student patiently followed the tutorial to create an alphabet beatbox. They added a background and the letters FOX. Pressing the letter F made music play, and the other letters changed color when touched.



```
when this sprite clicked
play sound (Dubstep v) until done
play sound (Dance Sitar v) until done
play sound (Chill v) until done
play sound (Drum v) until done
play sound (Dance Head Nod v) until done
play sound (Drum Jam v) until done
play sound (Cymbal Echo v) until done
play sound (Dance Snare Beat v) until done

when this sprite clicked
change [COLOR v] effect by (25) 
```
{: .msb}



```
when this sprite clicked
play sound (Dubstep v) until done
play sound (Dance Sitar v) until done
play sound (Chill v) until done
play sound (Drum v) until done
play sound (Dance Head Nod v) until done
play sound (Drum Jam v) until done
play sound (Cymbal Echo v) until done
play sound (Dance Snare Beat v) until done

when this sprite clicked
change [COLOR v] effect by (25) 
```


<!-- ![play music](https://i.imgur.com/dXcq0qC.jpg)

![change color](https://i.imgur.com/6Lb1kuh.jpg) -->

We had a lot of fun dancing to the music!!!

This project has room for development. For example, the colors of the characters could change when the music changes. That would be very flashy. The limit is your imagination.

### September 7th Homework and Note to Parents

#### September 7th Homework

1. *On paper* (**NOT IN SCRATCH**) make a plan for a project you want to do in Scratch. 
  For example:
   1. What is the goal of the game/project? How do you succeed? What are the challenges? What is the story?
   2. What are the actions that players can take using the mouse and keyboard? 
   3. What sprites are there? Who are the actors and what are the objects you need?
   4. What backdrops do you need? What are the settings (places) where things happen?
2. (Optional) If you want to work in scratch, make improvements to the Colorful Trails Project. Show me what you can do! Do your best to figure out on your own things such as how to:
   1. Add buttons that do things
   2. Add music and sounds
   3. Add additional movements
   4. Add/Change costumes and backdrops.
   5. Create a second screen?
3. (Optional) There were lots of new ideas last week. It would be a good idea to review (at least the pictures of) what we did in class (below). Can you do everything we covered (see below)? 

#### Note to Parents: Bring a Mouse
Some children struggled using touchpads. I recommend having children **bring a computer mouse** to class.

#### Note to Parents: Install Chrome
Students are using different browsers. To avoid confusion we are wondering, if possible, if parents could **install Chrome** on their child's computer. Here is the [download link](https://support.google.com/chrome/answer/95346). 



### September 7th Class Summary

Today I began with a rough overview of Scratch:

We covered, briefly, how to:
* add a costume to the background and sprites
* save and import a photo.
* make sprites speak
* add music extension
* press a key (`b`) to **change the background** 

```
when [b v] key pressed
next backdrop
```
{: .msb}

```
when [b v] key pressed
next backdrop
```

* press a key (`s`) to **play sounds** 


```
when [s v] key pressed
set volume to (100) %
forever
play sound (Dance Slow Mo v) until done 
end
```
{: .msb}


```
when [s v] key pressed
set volume to (100) %
forever
play sound (Dance Slow Mo v) until done 
end
```

* Say words in different languages and accents


```
set voice to (squeak v) :: tts
set language to (Korean v) :: tts
set tempo to (10) :: music
change (pitch v) effect by (10)
change (pitch v) effect by (10)
speak (Mario, Mario) :: tts
```
{: .msb}


```
set voice to (squeak v) :: tts
set language to (Korean v) :: tts
set tempo to (10) :: music
change (pitch v) effect by (10)
change (pitch v) effect by (10)
speak (Mario, Mario) :: tts
```

A lot of new information, so we will go over all this again as the class continues.

### Making Music 
*Note that sounds and music are different for scratch. Sounds are recorded, music is played.*
#### 1. Add Music Extension
To make music using instruments you have to add [music extension](https://media.giphy.com/media/QTmDHXHASop0qWUDFn/giphy.gif)

{% include giphy.html link="https://media.giphy.com/media/QTmDHXHASop0qWUDFn/" %} 

#### 2. Use the music blocks
Then music blocks appear at the bottom of the block section and you can use them just like the sound blocks:


```
when [p v] key pressed
set volume to (100) %
repeat (10)
play drum (\(1\) Snare Drum v) for (0.25) beats :: music
play note (60) for (0.25) seconds
set instrument to (\(1\) Piano v)
end 
```
{: .msb}


```
when [p v] key pressed
set volume to (100) %
repeat (10)
play drum (\(1\) Snare Drum v) for (0.25) beats :: music
play note (60) for (0.25) seconds
set instrument to (\(1\) Piano v)
end 
```

<!-- ![play music](https://i.imgur.com/44g6H5Y.jpg) -->


* remember, the music blocks and the sound blocks are different!!

#### 3. Stopping  and Start
The question "how to make the music stop" came up. One "quick" way to make the music stop is to set volume to zero by **pressing a key**:


```
when [p v] key pressed
set volume to (0) %
```
{: .msb}


```
when [p v] key pressed
set volume to (0) %
```


This doesn't work too well. To do it properly though is a bit difficult!!!! It requires the **forever repeat until costume trick**.


```
when green flag clicked
forever
repeat until <([costume name v] of (Control Music v)) = (stop)>
play sound (Dance Slow Mo v) until done
end 
end 
```
{: .msb}


```
when green flag clicked
forever
repeat until <([costume name v] of (Control Music v)) = (stop)>
play sound (Dance Slow Mo v) until done
end 
end 
```

<!-- ![stop music forever repeat until costume trick](https://i.imgur.com/2FneO4Y.jpg) -->

I will explain this in a future class!

### August 31st Homework:

The homework is to look inside the Colorful Trails Project (see below) and think about:

1. How could we make Colorful Trails more interesting? (e.g. make it slower, add music, etc.)
2. How could we add more characters and backgrounds
3. How to make it so if I press "c" it clears the board.

Here is my [example remix](https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/421636996/). Loot at how I:

* changed the costumes to letters to spell out my name
* added music 
* added buttons to stop and go:

<iframe src="https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/421636996/embed" allowtransparency="true"  width="485" height="485" frameborder="0" scrolling="no" allowfullscreen></iframe>


### Intro to Scratch 

Today I gave a basic outline of the scratch website. I explained how to: 

* Find your User ID, Stuff, and mailbox

You can see in the picture below how to get **your profile** page, **your stuff** page, **account settings**, and how to **sign out**. The folder icon (With the orange S) also goes to **your stuff**.


![folder in the upper right](https://i.imgur.com/vN7VHRa.jpg)


* Find the [Jr. Coders 2020 Monday Class Studio](https://scratch.mit.edu/studios/27394220/) 


On your profile page is a section called "Studios I'm Following". I have  added the  [Jr. Coders Monday studio](https://scratch.mit.edu/studios/27394220/) is where I will occasionally post assignments and other items for the class. 

![profile ](https://i.imgur.com/lFK8l6t.jpg)


* Go to My Stuff

The **my stuff** page is where your projects and studios are found. You can see buttons (top right) for creating **new projects**, **new studios**.

![](https://i.imgur.com/ThRgNql.jpg)

* Remix, add to studio, favorite, see inside

From project pages you can:

1. Remix: Make your own copy of a project so you can edit it
2. Add a project to a studio, which is a way of collecting projects you like.
3. Favorite: This is another way to collect projects. This also appears on the **your stuff** page. 
4. See inside: This allows you to look at the code inside a project.
5. Run the project: Click one of the green flags.
6. Stop a project: click the red stop sign.
![project page](https://i.imgur.com/B5ySkDH.jpg)


### August 31st Sample Projects 

#### Slash Knight 
We opened some sample projects. [Slash Knight](https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/419503825/) was especially popular.

<iframe src="https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/419503825/embed" allowtransparency="true"  width="485" height="485" frameborder="0" scrolling="no" allowfullscreen></iframe>

#### Colorful Trails
Another popular project was the [Colorful Trails Project](https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/10001052/).

<iframe src="https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/10001052/embed" allowtransparency="true"  width="485" height="485" frameborder="0" scrolling="no" allowfullscreen></iframe>


Kids made a remix of it, and we did a preliminary review of how to:

* create new backgrounds and characters 
* save our projects and the 
* different blocks 
  
without going into too much detail.

### August 24th Homework Review 

We did a brief review of what kids had been working on for the week based on the Walk Though the Forest project. I had planned to work on the Creating Rain Project (as I said last week), I told students that we might transition to using Scratch. The kids were very excited to see what it was like, so that became the focus of the day. 

### Scratch

Scratch is web based. We visited [the scratch website](http://scratch.mit.edu) and by pressing the "Create" button students could start exploring. Kids were very interested in choosing sprites: 

![choosing](https://i.imgur.com/ImoUoyE.jpg){: target="_blank_"}

and editing sprites: 

![editing](https://i.imgur.com/NpAvJPh.jpg){: target="_blank_"}

### Scratch Accounts

To make it easier to manage the student accounts I have created accounts and passwords for each student. These will be send to each student separately. Once you have your login information, [login to the scratch website](http://scratch.mit.edu){: target="_blank_"} using the id and password. 

### Scratch Jr. Coders 2020 Monday Class Studio

Scratch lets you group related projects into Studios. I have created a studio just for the Jr. Coders 2020 Monday Class. For the student accounts I have set them to ["follow" this studio](https://scratch.mit.edu/studios/27394220/){: target="_blank_"}. 

Inside the studio you can see [my Sample Shared Project](https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/420090077/){: target="_blank_"}. We will look at this more closely next class, but here you can see how it looks:

<iframe src="https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/420090077/embed" allowtransparency="true" width="485" height="485" frameborder="0" scrolling="no" allowfullscreen></iframe>


### August 24th Homework 

For the next few weeks we will do a combination of finishing Scratch Jr. and Starting Scratch. The homework is to:

* Finish any Scratch Jr. projects you are working on
* Visit and/or Log into Scratch and start exploring and playing.

### August 17th Review and Homework 

There were only 2 kids today, so we just continued to work on the Walk throught the forest project. The main idea of the project is that the character just continues to walk along on one screen and things come along and happen to him. The extended video below shows what I mean. See how the poison rain comes and he is touched by it. Some ideas of what could happen next:

* A mountain comes and he has to climb it.
* A fairy comes and offers him a glass of water.
* Many flies come and chase him out of the screen into another screen, or into a river.

Add your own!!

### Next Project Creating Rain

Once we finish this project we will learn how to make rain.

### August 3rd Homework Review

As usual, we review the homework. The main goal of the project was to show how to create the illusion of movement using moving characters and screen transitions. 

### Original Project: A Walk In the Forest 
I created the A Walk In the Forest Project to help reinforce that idea. The project creates the illusion of continuous motion by having characters moving continuously behind a fixed character. I showed the students the project and their first challenge was to recreate the project. They had to discover:

* Adding 3 grass elements to the bottom of the screen and having them move right continuously makes it look like the cat is moving.
* Adding several trees also moving makes it look like he is walking in a forest. 

The next stage was making it look like he is coming out of the forest:

* The trees run through a few 20 step loops, one loop for each time across the screen.
* At the end, each tree has to move just the right amount to get to the left edge of the screen before disappearing.
* This takes a little math. They have to find the starting position of each tree, and add just that amount to the motion, then disappear.

{% include niceimage-galleryNoTableweserveGifsNoLink.html folder="/images/2020-08-10/" %}


### August 10th Homework
The homework is to now make the cat move onto a new environment, such as having rain appear (you can just see it start to happen in the image above), or animals flying. How can you make these appear at just the right moment, and make it seems like the cat is walking through them? Good luck!

Here is a full example. Notice how the clouds appear. For example, another character might appear from the right, and the two characters might fight in the center, then the character could move on.

### August 3rd Homework Review 


We reviewed Flying Project Homework. Some kids used the same background, but some chose a night scene or other scene. Most kids were able to create the first screen with ease, so we moved on to how to create the cool "rising into the sky" effect. 

First we tried it with the kids just looking at the result and trying to code it without any help. Then I helped overcome problems, and gave suggestions on how to improve it.

The transition involves several steps:

1. The [P1 Pilot](#imagegallery2-Y2R13Flying-P1_Pilot) is touched and he rises to the top of the screen and disappears. 

2. The second screen appears. the [P2 Pilot](#imagegallery2-Y2R13Flying-P2_Pilot)  is flying up in the air though the tops of the [P2 Trees](#imagegallery2-Y2R13Flying-P2_Tree3).

3. The key is that this background screen is the *visual continuation* of the screen below it. This creates the effect of rising into the sky.

4. To make the effect clearer, the top of the trees in screen one (these are part of the background) are added to the bottom of screen two (these are characters). 

5. When we get to screen 2, these [P2 Trees4](#imagegallery2-Y2R13Flying-P2_Tree4) go down, making it look like we are rising into the sky above the trees.

6. The effect is better when the trees go down slowly, and disappear at different times. 

7. We spent a lot of time figuring out how to draw [P2 Clouds2](#imagegallery2-Y2R13Flying-P2_Cloud2)   using circles. I didn't quite finish this but explained the basic idea. Drawing a circle with a border covered by a circle without creates the cloud shape in the project.

8. I also discussed how to make small stars by drawing a small line with just two dots and bringing the dots just over each other. This was used by one of the students who was using a night background.

9. You can see how the effect is created in the gallery below.


{% include niceimage-galleryNoTableweserveGifsNoLink.html folder="/scratchProjects/Y2R13Flying/" %}

### August 3rd Homework

Now that we know how to make the "rising up" effect, you can finish making the Flying Project. That is the homework. Can you make the the plane fly up in screens 1, 2, 3, and then back down using screens 3, 4, 1?

* Next class: We work on using the same effect in other ways.
