### Recap for November 22nd

Christmas Project 
  : Today I gave the kids an Christmas project assignment. The project is intended as an assessment of their progress in the class, and after some initial reluctance, the kids seemed on board with it. The project must include the following elements (and related  skills): 

1. - [ ] Must be appropriate to the theme of Christmas and the interesting creative and original

2. - [ ] Include sounds on start and on click (sound block)
 
1. - [ ] Change appearance of characters on events (Looks size and costume block)

3. - [ ] Have sprite speak (Say block)

 
2. - [ ] Have a recorded message on key press (record, play, when key pressed)

4. - [ ] Have 2 different Sprites doing 2 different motions at same time (switching sprites)
 
3. - [ ] Change the background and sprites in that background (backdrop change)

 
4. - [ ] Have a Sprite jump 5 times using glide (Glide, x and y position, repeat loops)

5. - [ ] Have a drum play 3 different beats and change color each time it changes beats (sound, color effects)

6. - [ ] Pick a dancing sprite and change the costume to make it look like they are dancing (import costumes, change costumes)

Some samples, so far.

Basic Paint Battle Game
  : Today, some students worked on modifying a basic Paint Battle/Splatton type game.

{% include zakviewer.html Name="PBRR base game 2021 11 15 on Scratch" ID="https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/602449292/" caption="If you press space, a number representing the amount of white appears. The lower this number, the better your score." %}

The goal for them was to add their own character, make the character move randomly around the screen. Then, using the brightness effect, the character should stamp a white outline of itself, which erases any paint blobs beneath it. To do this they use blocks like this:

{% include imgur.html title="" ID="https://i.imgur.com/dhcLgZh.png" caption="" width="" height="" spacer="" %}


Student S
  : This version includes two games in one. 

{% include zakviewer.html Name="Student S Paint battle rifle randomized" ID="https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/601619813/" caption="In addition to the splatton type game, you have to avoid the squid. If your mouse touches the squid, the game is over." %}


Student M 
  : He used a house for his character. 
{% include zakviewer.html Name="Paint battle rifle randomized remix on Scratch" ID="https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/601341489/" caption="" %}

Student A
  : This game uses a star moving in a circle, and another character that says stop.

Student J
  : Student J used a Dinosaur for his character

Individual Projects 
  : Other students worked on individual projects. 

Sea Bun Pet 
  : Student K is in the process of creating a Sea Bun Pet Game. She is using various when key pressed blocks to do various actions.

Animating a character
  : Student A added an animation to her Mario Game (Like Grey) character. She stumbled at one point because she made the character change costume twice, which undid the action she wanted. That game being finished, she looked for a new project to do.

{% include zakviewer.html Name="Like Grey copy" ID="https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/593059358/" caption="" %}


Ask Block
  : Student K learned how to use the ask block, make a variable to store the value of the answer, and show the answer on the screen. For a while she worked with a drawing tablet, and explored using the paint area functions.


FNF
  : Student H made his movie stop when it reached a certain size, then continue until it was finished by using a repeat until block. He figured out by himself how to switch to the menu screen when the intro movie was finished and show the first character. Well, almost...


Splatoon
  : Student M hacked a Splatoon type project by adding more characters and giving them more powers. He did some debugging when the up arrow motion on his characters stopped moving. Student M know alot about how games are played and how to hack them to make them more playable, his challenge will be on taking those skills and making his own games. 

{% include zakviewer.html Name="スプラトゥーン / splatoon remix" ID="https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/596375420/" caption="" %}


Inventing a new game: Death Ray Variation
  : Student S started with a death ray 
  
{% include zakviewer.html Name="Death Rays" ID="https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/587873991/" caption="This a teacher demo of various rays..." %}

and turned it into a game. He created several "enemy balls" that attack Voldermort by going to edges and gliding towards him. If they touch a death ray, they "die". We did some debugging so that they would return to their original position when hit.

{% include zakviewer.html Name="Death Rays\. copy remix on Scratch" ID="https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/597164047/" caption="The return to original position is still unfinished" %}

First Platformer
  :  Student J wanted to make a Mario type game. He quickly learned how to make backgrounds and his main sprite. He wanted to edit his background, but couldn'T because it was a bitmap, which led to an attempt at a simple explanation of the difference between bitmap and vector drawing.

Underwater Sea Slug Project 
  : Following on their interest in Sea Slugs, Student K made the beginnings of and undersea themed project. They used pixlr to remove the background from an image of a sea slug. They used a lot of when key pressed and switch backdrop and backdrop changed blocks to control the visible items, and included an instructions page. They also began using the ask block.

{% include zakviewer.html Name="Sea Slug Project" ID="https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/593633417/" caption="Press any key to see the instructions page" %}

Soccer game
  : Student J made their first Scratch Project, a soccer game project.


{% include zakviewer.html Name="Soccer Game 2021 11 01" ID="https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/593083121/" caption="press the green flag to see the player move." %}


Space Shooter 
  : Student S made great strides on his space shooter. We discussed the advantages and disadvantages of using individual sprites and of using clones for this type of project. After thinking about it he chose to use individual sprites, and meticulously copied and verified his code in each one. By using glides instead of move blocks for the balls this project became quite challenging and different than the usual Space invaders game. Other students really enjoyeed watching and playing this game.

{% include zakviewer.html Name="Space Invaders 2021 11 01 on Scratch" ID="https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/593635410/" caption="Press left and right arrow to move shooter and up arrow to shoot." %}

Remix and Hack
  : Student M continues to explore a variety of games. He enjoys in changing them so they are more playable. Today's favorite was a Submarine game.
{% include zakviewer.html Name="Submarin remix on Scratch" ID="https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/593081843/" caption="" %}

FNF 
  : Student H continues his FNF game. He spent some time collecting and selecting resources for the project. In addition, he developed a plan for the opening sequence, and began walking through coding the initial sequence together. 

{% include zakviewer.html Name="FNF resources remix copy on Scratch" ID="https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/593081941/" caption="Press Story to start the opening sequence." %}

Clicker Game and Shooting Game
  : Student S finished his Space Clicker Game, and began a new project. The first challenge in the new game was how to make the balls take random positions only in the upper half of the screen. I encouraged him to define exactly where he wanted the balls to go in words, and as he did it he figured out how to do it.

{% include zakviewer.html Name="Shootgame 2021 10 25 S original slightly modified" ID="https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/589645847/" caption="" %}

{% include zakviewer.html Name="Space clicker" ID="https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/562106841/" caption="" %}

FNF
  : Student H started out by analyzing several versions of Friday Night Funkin', and making list of resources, actors, events, and features he wanted to include in his own version of the game. After doing that, he began designing his own main character. 


Corrections and Hacks
  : Student M's specialty is hacking existing projects to make them infinitely playable or behave interestingly. Last week he made some changes to one project, but it didn't quite work the way he wanted. This week we worked through how to get the bullets to fly at the right angle by pointing the second shooter in the right direction, and getting the bullet to point in the same direction. He also worked on hacking some more projects. He had gained wide experience on how different games work.

{% include zakviewer.html Name="TD for M 2021 10 18 Fixed" ID="https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/586318215/" caption="" %}

Platformer with Lava
  : Student A picked up on project that you've made quite some time ago we added traps lava and spikes to her project we started out with a simple lava and then we I showed her how to make it appear only on a particular screen when she understood that basic method she then on her own created similar pitfalls on all the other screens

ScratchJr. Music Project
  : Student J in ScratchJr. had an original idea for a music project where a drum of hammer would hit a drum and make a sound. We then expanded this by adding more drums and by making the hammer twirl across the screen

{% include imgurmp4.html link="https://i.imgur.com/8IClyf8.mp4" %}


Soundtrap
  : Student K opened a new Sountrap account and began exploring adding tracks and modifying them to make interesting sounds. Today was mostly an exploration day, and maybe next week we will try some more guided work.

### Recap for October 18th


* Student J worked on developing his ScratchJr. Space Invaders into a story with a game. The story begins with a villain disrupting 2 by-standers. A hero comes and the villain and hero fight (i.e. the Space Invaders game). When the player wins the game, the hero then returns to the bystanders. The coding involved a variety of blocks, including the introduction of the change scene block.


* Student A completed a new String Figures game and began planning her next project.

{% include zakviewer.html Name="Ayatori" ID="https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/582228901/" caption="The student learned how to add project instructions ot the background using the text box control in the paint editor." %}

* Student S continued his Clicker game. This week he added a timer, which involved identifying the places where the timer needed to be reset and where it should be tested to trigger the game over condition. 


* Student H found a model for a project from a modification of the Friday Night Funk Music Rhythm game, and began to recreate the model by importing characters, coding basic movement, and designing his home screen and how it would function. 

{% include zakviewer.html Name="FNF vs. Mickey" ID="https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/586292667/" caption="In addition to this inital coding, he developed a clear set of events and actions for the beginning of his game that he will implement next class." %}


* Student M worked on modifying a Tower Defense game. He added a new character and attempted to recreate the bullet firing event by reusing and modifying code. He began to understand (with a little help) how to identify the relevant pieces of code. As class ended however, he introduced a coding error that will give him a chance to practice troubleshooting next week. This is still a work in progress but an interesting challenge. 


* Student H2 worked on a project inspired by the Battle Cats project. 

* Student K was introduced to using a drawing tablet and made several new characters using it.

### Recap for October 11th

We played a game based on a lecture by [Professor 井本陽久](https://logmi.jp/business/articles/322794). The game consists of a 6x6 grid. Student place a "1" in 6 of the squares. The remaining squares in the grid automatically receive higher number based on the game rules. The goal is to produce the highest possible number in the grid. If the "1"s represent people who have a virus in a room, people who "get sick" (higher numbers) are ones standing next to 2 or more sick people. The later numbers represent people who get sick after so many days. The goal of the game is both to get everyone sick, but as slowly as possible. 

The game is very good for teaching logical thinking, problems solving, concentration, amongst other other mental skills. Kids worked on their own, with some kids being able to beat the minimum score of 6. The game is open ended in that no one knows what the highest possible number is. In fact, after working very hard on it for an hours, student S was able to get to 18, beat the highest number given in the original lecture, 17. I have read that 23 is possible, but have 

In the leftover time, students then also worked on their own projects. Some notable progress included:

* Student J learned how to make messages by adding movement buttons to a ScratchJr. Space Invaders Game.
* Student A began a "string figures" game in Scratch.
* Student S continued his Clicker game.
* Student H contemplated a Carnage Symbiote project.
* Student M worked on a video sensing jukebox:

Drawing
  : Today there was some interest in drawing and costume design.

Student K focused on very detailed drawing of "a bag of flesh". They asked for some help making "tears" and I suggested using variable length/width lines. 

{% include imgur.html title="draw" ID="https://i.imgur.com/umAvVfe.png" caption="" width="200px" height="" spacer="" %}



Somewhat inspired by the above, we installed the Scratch Addons Extension on student H's computer so he could use onionskinning to copy images, and he began to copy images he drew, somewhat inspired by Student K's image. 

{% include imgur.html title="Bag of flesh" ID="https://i.imgur.com/izeWT7Y.png" caption="" height="" width="200px"  spacer="" %}


He also spent some time drawing his own character for a "madness combat deimos" game. The first step will be creating skins and weapons for the player to choose.
Student S  made attractive game over screens for his clicker game. We talked about the relative merits of using individual sprites over costumes, and how to track time in order to decide when the player loses.

{% include imgur.html title="" ID="https://i.imgur.com/tu52quK.png" caption="" width="200px" height="" spacer="" %}

{% include imgur.html title="" ID="https://i.imgur.com/Vl2MPjq.png" caption="" width="200px" height="" spacer="" %}


So close and yet so far.
  : Student S was quite puzzled when his "red ball" character did not disappear at the edge like it was supposed to. 

{% include imgur.html title="" ID="https://i.imgur.com/1Lc6DVi.png" caption="The red ball is right at the edge. Or is it??" width="200px" height="" spacer="" %}

It turned out, after being led on many false trails, that the ball was exactly 1 pixel off from the edge, just not quite close enough to register as touching. Despite the trouble, it was a good opportunity to demonstrate some debugging/problem solving strategies.


Hacking
  : Students M, H, and A explored projects in Scratch in search of ideas for future projects. They hacked the health points of projects so they could play indefinitely. Student M also added more music to his music jukebox.

Making It Rain
  : Student J started making a Space Invaders game in ScratchJr. He made 31 "dot" characters (we counted) and we worked together to make the dots behave like rain by using move blocks, a message block, some speed blocks, and some infinite loop blocks.

### Recap for September 27th

Today we started out by taking an bird's eye view of a project, to understand how a project is made from beginning to end.  I briefly reviewed [this breakdown](./../lessons/BattleCats.html). The purpose was to demonstrate:

   * How to think about their projects as a whole. Children sometimes get lost in details or in the early steps of a project, without a clear idea of where the project is heading.
  * At the same time, helping them see how the details need to work together to reach that goal. 
  * How to translate their project ideas from the image in their minds into the object language they are programming in, in this case Scratch. This is a crucial step in coding, but is not merely a question of knowing the object language, but of the previous elements. Developing both of these is what this exercise promoted.
  * This leads to a sense of the importance and benefits of planning games beforehand
  * I also touched on some of the common elements of many games, such as initialization and game over screens, and to begin including them in their games.
  * In addition, I tried to encourage them to focus more on the player experience, which many of our students struggle with or neglect.

After a brief discussion, I had children put away their computer and gave them a sheet of paper. They were asked to write down an overview of their current project incorporating the elements we had talked about. Once they completed this, they could start working on their projects again.

For example:

  * Student A was able to add Money Buttons to a Battle Cats project she had started last week. She also made sure that the player began with no money at the start of the game. 
  * Student S made a concrete plan for his project including a game over screen and a clear way for the player to win or lose based on timing the player's clicks.
  * In addition to planning out their overall game, Student K began planning out a character design stage, including choosing 5 hats, wings and tails. We worked out how many characters she would need to make, as well as how many possible characters could be designed.
  * Student M took an existing project and came up with ideas for adding balloons that would pop out when a character defeated an enemy.
  * Student H plotted out his game including 3 different ways (falling, fighting) the player could lose points, and began designing his characters.
  * Student J came up with an original idea for a ScratchJr Project, a puzzle game. We talked about how this could be done within ScratchJr.'s limitations, and I showed him a trick in the paint screen that would allow him to have his pieces fit together nicely.

In the end I think this was a very successful exercise. It was clear from the way kids proceeded on their projects that they were now thinking more actively and purposefully about their projects, not merely copying code or focusing on one step at a time.

### Recap for September 13th

Today kids worked on their own projects. 

One kid finished his Basketball Project. Another made great strides in his clicker game,a test project to test out various blocks and techniques, and apply tricks used in the Pacman Project. This project uses skills such as sending messages, forever loops, my blocks, repeats. 

{% include zakviewer.html Name="Space clicker" ID="https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/562106841/" caption="" %}

Student K explored the sounds interface in the scratch editor, sampling and tweaking a variety of sounds to create bizarre effects.

Some kids who were looking for a new project became interested in Battle Cats project I recently made. The game had one interesting feature: It was programmed to so the player would always lose. This was as an incentive to get kids to want to change it. I encouraged them to open it up and they hacked it right away. 

After playing with it a while they started asking for help making it better and adding other characters and changing the interface. 

{% include zakviewer.html Name="Battle Cats simple no shop 2 remix" ID="https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/569638451/" caption="" %}

Lastly, ScratchJr. student J completed a maze project mostly on his own with occasional prompting. We worked on using the drawing interface, especially in drawing straight line and corners. This is a bit buggy in scratch junior so it needs special attention and he did great mastering it. He seemed comfortable with all the parts of this project, and I will give him something more challenging next week.

### Recap for September 6th

Today we (nearly) finished making the basic Mario game based on Grey. We added more levels and made the flag switch the levels.


{% include zakviewer.html Name="Student A" ID="https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/564896769/" caption="Great project!" %}


{% include zakviewer.html Name="Student M" ID="https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/564897209/" caption="" %}

{% include zakviewer.html Name="Student H" ID="https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/564897884/" caption="" %}

{% include zakviewer.html Name="Student S" ID="https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/564896942/" caption="" %}

One student learned how to change his profile and downsize and image. We talked about the fact that the move block needs to know which direction to move, and that moving in a negative direction moves backwards.

Student K joined us for the first time today. They made a somewhat different version of the game, focusing more on blocks they were familiar with. For example, they struggled with making the cat move up and down, and hardcoded the movement with set y blocks rather than using change y by blocks. They worked on making the cat face in different dirrections.


Instead of levels, they made individual platforms. This is just a different way of doing this project, and a good way to reinforce what you know while building to new skills. Towards the end we added some new blocks, such as if and sensing blocks to test for contact.


{% include zakviewer.html Name="beeps adventure" ID="https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/567151154/" caption="" %}

We also had a ScratchJr. Student who continued working on their Issun-bōshi (Tom Thumb) Story, and remaking sample projects.

### Recap for August 30th

Today we worked a group on a very basic platformer project based on a project called Grey.  It includes only the essentials, but it introduces concepts like variables, My Blocks, if blocks to detect keypresses, gravity,  and "pulling up out of the ground" particle physics, and even a little tutorial on drawing triangles. This project forms the basis of most platform and scrolling projects and can be easily modified to suit almost any project.


{% include zakviewer.html Name="Basic Platformer Based on Grey" ID="https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/564896968/" caption="So far we have created the player, added gravity, and pulled the character out of the ground when it falls." %}

We had a lot of kids working on it and once, with some technical issues, a few mistakes by me, and the occasional distraction, so it was slow going. The good news is the hard part is over, and it gets easier from here. Next week we start movement.


Students also worked on individual projects, such as a clicker game, a basketball project, and a shooting game in Tynker.

## August 23rd

Several announcements:
  : The class notes for last weekend are on the website. We have had a lot of makeup classes recently, and, to avoid confusion, let me explicitly state that class notes for your child's makeup classes are on the page for their usual class, not for the day they attended. For example a Monday student who attends a makeup on Friday will have any notes relevant to him/her on the Monday Page. 

  : Since we are heading into another Emergency Period, we will be strictly enforcing our Covid guidelines around hand washing, social distancing and mask wearing, etc. If you could remind your child these are important rules and of the need to cooperate with them that would be helpful. In addition, seating and snack times will be staggered accordingly.

  : We are pleased that for the most part students are focused and attentive during class, and with their cooperation we are creating a fun, relaxed, yet productive learning environment. However, to maintain this, it would be a good time to remind your child that the main activity in class should be working on assignments and projects, i.e. learning to code. I want to avoid ending the day with a child not having made any tangible progress.  Exploring games and playing them, while educational and part of our goal, is better done at home.

  : (To clarify: We do encourage students to explore the many games that Scratch and Tynker make available, and investigating and hacking other projects is a valid part of learning. We also understand the temptation to play them in class is very strong. However, this can easily become a distraction (for them and others) and a gentle reminder from parents would help me better keep these factors in balance. We do provide free time during breaks, and this is not meant as a ban, but a reminder.)

  : Lastly, our class policy is that students should make an effort to communicate, even amongst themselves, in English, as much as practicable, especially during the first section of class. We understand the limitations around this, but we want to be sure this expectation is clearly understood by all so that we can help support them with this. 

### Recap for August 23rd

Student H made an original Basketball project. He was able to code the motion of the ball, including the initial wait with minimal prompting. He began to understand how to connect the idea in his head with the blocks and code in his project.

{% include zakviewer.html Name="Basketball 08 23" ID="https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/562811122/" caption="" %}

Student A continued working on her Pacman project. She added many more pills and ghosts. She was able to figure out by herself how to implement the code so the the ghosts to not go through walls. However they would get stuck on the wall, and with a some very minor help in debugging, she got it working. Great job!

{% include zakviewer.html Name="Pacman 08 23" ID="https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/557526306/" caption="" %}



Student M continue his Dragon Vs. Choppers game. He got stuck at one point as there was a mysterious bug in Tynker where one clone wouldn't delete. After much effort by both us us, we just replaced the actor with annoher one and rewrote the code. AAll fixed.

Student M made many modifications to a Tynker Dragon and Choppers Tutorial. He added many more attackers, and also another Dragon. He made the new attackers able to attack new dragon, and created new weapons for the dragon, including a fireball and a bomb, and created keypresses for firing them. We also debugged the bomb to so it wouldn't explode if it was touching the dragon. At first he was merely copying and pasting code, his modifications show an understanding of how the code worked.

Today we walked through a basic Pacman game. There were only 2 kids today, so it went very smoothly and we make a lot of progress. The kids worked hard straight to the end, with only a short break!

{% include zakviewer.html Name="PAC 2021 08 02 class project" ID="https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/557526249/" caption="

This involves

* making the pacman, including 'painting with transparency' 
* making the background and maze
* teaching the pacman to move
* teaching it to bounce off walls
* adding a pill
* initializing the pill and pacman
* teaching the pill to hide when pacman touches it<span>" %}

Today kids worked on their own projects mostly. 

Importing GIFs
  : Student H learned that he could import gif files easily into Scratch, and it would extract the images inside it. This inspired him to make a "comical" project with some of his favorite gifs.

{% include zakviewer.html Name="smg4" ID="https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/554323778/" caption="" %}

Singer
  : For this project, Student H made the singer sing using if key pressed and repeat until not pressed blocks. 

{% include zakviewer.html Name="" ID="https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/556368023/" caption="If the left arrow and up arrow key are pressed, the actor will 'speak' as long as the up arrow key is being pressed." %}

Duck Breaks Egg
  : Student S invented his own Duck Breaks Egg game, where the arrow keys are used to make the Duck break the egg. At first one could only break one egg per game. I challenged him to make it so we could press space button to keep playing. We also displayed the score. Once he managed that I challenged him ot make the game progressively harder, such as by changing the speed of the egg's getaway.

Spin Launcher 
: Student M completed the following Spin Launcher Tutorial. This project teaches about program physics, such as velocity, friction, and restitution.

### Recap for July 19th

Today we started off with a series of tests ([test 1](https://scratch.mit.edu/studios/30066443), [test 2](https://scratch.mit.edu/studios/30066443), [test 3](https://scratch.mit.edu/studios/30066443))based on the recent Mario galaxy 4 projects. Students were given a set of blocks and instructions to turn those blocks into particular actions. For example, these blocks

![Imgur](https://i.imgur.com/8aIbtoh.jpg)

were used to make the actor go up and down and touch the donut:

![Imgur](https://i.imgur.com/YpYX7o5.jpg)

The first test was pretty easy, but the last one required some thinking. I was pleased that they were all able to complete it, with a little help.

After that, kids continued their own projects and tutorials. I also showed them this video sensing project, which inspired at least one kid to develop his own version, which kids enjoyed.

{% include zakviewer.html Name="video jukebox sample 01" ID="https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/553933754/" caption="follow link to see it in action" %}

We closed the day with a new game, ["Hackenbush"](http://www.papg.com/show?1TMP=). In addition to being fun, it helps teaches about thinking ahead and basic logic.

### Recap for July 12th


Today's main lesson was to continue the Mario Galaxy 4 project, finishing step 3 and starting step 4. First, students installed an addon to the chrome browser to make it easier to edit in scratch. We added code to go to a new level when the donut is eaten by kuma. We also added some sound, and made the donut move to a new location. 

```
when @greenFlag clicked // in the donut
forever
    if <touching [kuma v]?> then
        start sound [Chomp v]
        broadcast [next level v]
        point in direction (pick random (-179) to (180))
        wait (0.5) seconds
    end
end
```
{: .msb}

We then added a variable called level. We initialized the level, and updated it each time we reached a new level. We learned how to show the level. 

```
when @greenFlag clicked // in the earth, we 
set [Level v] to [1]
switch costume to [earth v]
go to x: (0) y: (0)

when I receive [next level v] // in the earth
change [Level v] by (1) 
next costume
```
{: .msb}

We also briefly touched on how to make characters larger and smaller in the paint editor using the onionskin tool.

Today we worked as a group on a new project, based on Mario Galaxy 4. I broke the orignal project down into steps, and we walked through them as a group. The kids were really focused and we managed to get through 2 1/2 steps. The kids were able to individualize their projects, and, even if the code is almost the same, each one has a unique character to it.
