On paper she designed the outlines of the project. She signed into her class account and began coding.  " %}


{% include imgur.html title="" ID="https://i.imgur.com/l3cbKud.png" caption="She had to use several concepts today that seemed new or relatively for her. For example, she learned how to use the ask and answer blocks to get user input. She wasn't sure how to take her draft and turn it into an 'if then else' statement, and then I showed her how to create the 'answer = ~' conditional. She as very excited to learn how to duplicate blocks. When we tested her original code, she saw that the 'try again' message only appeared one time. I suggested a 'repeat until block' might help her solve that problem and she quickly realized its potential. I showed her a trick so that the first time the message says 'Type in my code' but if needed the loop repeats with a 'Try again' message until the right answer is provided. Next week she plans to make a parachute game with another student." width="" height="" spacer="" %}


{% include imgur.html title="" ID="https://i.imgur.com/2GsNcr6.png" caption="Student made  an original maze project for me. She needed a little help counting the number of squares to go each step, and I worked with her quite a bit one on one to count steps at each turn. She was all smiles when the project was finished." width="" height="" spacer="" %}



{% include imgur.html title="Run Marco Run" ID="https://i.imgur.com/xCok9A3.gif" caption="Student T2 worked on the challenges on [Run Marco Run](http://runmarco.allcancode.com/). This self-guided lesson serves as an ideal first introduction/review for Scratch. It introduces GUI elements like blocks and block manipulation, and emphasizes thinking ahead as students have to  plan their path through the maze in their head. It gives instant feedback, and by becoming progressively harder helps keeps them challenged and learning new tricks. Student T did a great job making his way through almost all the challenges, and will be ready for Scratch next lesson." width="" height="" spacer="" %}


{% include imgur.html title="" ID="https://i.imgur.com/x0R5Ngv.png" caption="Student H made further progress on his 'Chaos Madness' project.

Student M is very clever at adapting existing games but this time I challenged him to create his own project from scratch. He decided to make his own Cat Owns an Inn project. 

{% include imgur.html title="" ID="https://i.imgur.com/xb0lHjc.png" caption="We used the broadcast and wait model to make the cats appear from the edge and when they hit each other the first cat goes to the hotel room.

### Recap for March 7th
 

Today we started with a simple exercise to demonstrate the concept of Events and actions. I went around the room and we created a project where each person would add one event/action pair.  Then I emphasized that each pair becomes a set of blocks in the project.

Our story was: 

1. When the green flag is clicked, The word "Game" and a character appear on teh screen.
2. When we press the character, he dances.
3. When he finishes dancing, sharks fly out of the sky and the word game disappears
4. When they are near the ground, they explode 
5. After they explode, the character dies.
6. After that a duck with a person on it pop on the screen.
7. They swim away.
8. When they are gone, the entire earth appears and everyone (on the earth) becomes Dwayne "the Rock" Johnson.

{% include zakviewer.html Name="2022-03-08 Man Shark Duck Rock on Scratch" ID="https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/655915522/" caption="" %}

Having done that, the students worked on their projects. Most began making their first sprites, as usual by either by getting them from the internet or drawwing them, removing backgrounds, modifying them, which I helped them do. 

Some reached the point where they were coding their projects as well, and most everyone seemed on track:

Today the class began a new Project Cycle/Contest. We reinforced expectations for class time and looked at the parts of Project Checklist/Storyboard for the Cycle.

{% include zakviewer.html Name="2022-02-27 2022 02 Project Cycle Challenges on Scratch" ID="https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/650291488/" caption="We reviewed the the full project cycle. First we discussed the Cycle Grading Scheme. Next we see how class time will be structured in the Cycle. This is only a slight modification of our current scheme. We
then reviewed the Project Checklist/Storyboard." %}

We made titles and talked about the goals of our projects. Then we looked at some example [Storyboards](./../lessons/Storyboards.html), and the students started making Storyboards.

* Goals, and Stoyboards

{% include niceimage-galleryNoTableweserveGifsNoLink.html folder="/images/2022-02-28/" %}

The homework for next week is to think about the storyboard for your project. This is a crucial step and we will work on it again next week.

Clones

Pat The Cat
  : Student K made this project, and I was asked for instruction on using messages to initiate actions, though it appears in the end this was not used.

### Recap for January 31st

Minecraft Travel Game 
  : Today we started a new class project. It is based on a version of Minecraft that I wrote. 

{% include zakviewer.html Name="2022-02-01 Minecraft Travel game V1" ID="https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/633644256/" caption="The object of the game is to get the player across the screen using only the given blocks." %}

So far we have done  : 

* Making a tile. This involves using the shift key to keep the tile square and careful sizing so the block is 15x15 pixels. We also make sure the costume is centered. 
* Making a head, body, leg, and arm. This uses the same skills. The arm costume has to be rotated to point forward.
* Using the point to cursor block to make the head and arm point to the mouse.
* Using a forever loop and go to and change y blocks to position the body, head, and arm securely. We talked about how much to change y depends on the size of the characters. 

```
when I receive [start round v]
forever
    go to [body v]    
    change y by ((10) + (12.5))
    point towards [mouse-pointer v] 
end
```

I explained how to adjust the size of the eraser tool to get fine control of the erasure. Then we worked together on creating a 'computer-generated behavior' (as he called it) for the character. I introduced some new blocks, like the distance from block I demonstrated a code to make the character move towards another if they are close enough. We talked about different rotation styles." %}

We had  an interesting bug to fix. He seemed unable to change his pen size. It turned out a missing pen up block in his code allowed the pen to move side to side so it looked like it was thicker than it was. A simple fix (a pen up block) and the pen size is working again." %}
