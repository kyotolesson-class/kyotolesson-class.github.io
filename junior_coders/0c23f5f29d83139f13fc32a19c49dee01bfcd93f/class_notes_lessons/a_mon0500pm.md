### Recap for January 31st

Minecraft Travel Game 
  : Today we started a new class project. It is based on a version of Minecraft that I wrote. 

{% include zakviewer.html Name="2022-02-01 Minecraft Travel game V1" ID="https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/633644256/" caption="The object of the game is to get the player across the screen using only the given blocks." %}

So far we have done  : 

* Making a tile. This involves using the shit key to keep the tile square and careful sizing so the block is 15x15 pixels. We also make sure the costume is centered. 
* Making a head, body, leg, and arm. This uses the same skills. The arm costume has to be rotated to point forward.
* Using the point to cursor block to make the head and arm point to the mouse.
* Using a forever loop and go to and change y blocks to position the body, head, and arm securely. We talked about how much to change y depends on the size of the characters. 

```
when I receive [start round v]
forever
    go to [body v]    
    change y by ((10) + (12.5))
    point towards [mouse-pointer v] 
end
```

{% include zakviewer.html Name="2022-01-25 madness" ID="https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/629444361/" caption="Student H added a new character and removed its head, a good review of previous skills. I explained how to adjust the size of the eraser tool to get fine control of the erasure. Then we worked together on creating a 'computer-generated behavior' (as he called it) for the character. I introduced some new blocks, like the distance from block I demonstrated a code to make the character move towards another if they are close enough. We talked about different rotation styles." %}

Then I  helped her be able to copy and reuse costumes to make the buttons and create a consistent look across the project." %}

{% include zakviewer.html Name="2022-01-24 Korean Dalgona game" ID="https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/629470386/" caption="Student S is working on a two person version of the Korean Dalgona game. We had  an interesting bug to fix. He seemed unable to change his pen size. It turned out a missing pen up block in his code allowed the pen to move side to side so it looked like it was thicker than it was. A simple fix (a pen up block) and the pen size is working again." %}
