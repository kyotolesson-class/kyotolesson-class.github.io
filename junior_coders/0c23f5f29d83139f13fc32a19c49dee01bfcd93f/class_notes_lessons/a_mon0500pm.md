### September 14th Note to students: 

Today's class was a bit challenging. Everyone was very eager to explore new Scratch projects, but I understand and it was natural if you had the feeling that some things are a little hard still. Hang in there!! 

I really encourage you to try the tutorials before getting too far into your own big projects. Of course it is exciting that there are lots of fancy projects and games to make, but you have to walk before you can run. 

For me, the important thing is that everyone made a lot of progress individually in this class! You can be proud of what you did! These notes are to highlight and help you see the progress you made. 

Again, please try the tutorials!!! It really will help!

### Sept 21 Homework

The homework is to:

* Review the class notes
* Finish the Animate My Name Tutorial  
* Keep working you whatever projects you started

### Do scratch tutorials

[scratch tutorials](https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/editor/?tutorial=all)

I started the class by asking kids look at and copy the animate a name tutorial. Most kids were very eager to start their own projects, so I had them work on the tutorial and went around the room to hear their ideas for their individual projects (as int he homework) before they started working on them.

### Success 1: Birthday Cakes

One success was making a birthday song/cake project. The project had two goals:

1. Making birthday candles light and unlight
2. Clicking dots to make the music stop and start

#### Birthday Candles Go On and Off

Small Dot sprites on the radio act as buttons. When you click the buttons, they turn the music on and off. 

![radio](https://i.imgur.com/q5NWd54.jpg)

The Cake sprite has 2 costumes.

![cake](https://i.imgur.com/a8WWROh.jpg)


The pink dot code makes the music play, and sends a message to the cake.  [](# "I corrected the student's project so the candles go out *after* the music plays."). The broadcast message block is just like the send message block in Scratch Jr., but more powerful.

![radio code](https://i.imgur.com/thdqNMT.jpg)

When the cake gets the message, it changes costume. This make it seems the candles are going out.

![radio code](https://i.imgur.com/ctYUBO0.jpg)

The red dot makes the music stop.

![radio code](https://i.imgur.com/IB9SwJh.jpg)

This is an excellent first project. Though you may have wanted to do more...it is a very good start. 

### Success 2: Cool Name animation

Letter sprites make the student's name appear sequentially. The key to this project is also using message blocks. On start, the letter sprites hide, wait, then each letter appears, waits, and tells the next to appear. 

![radio code](https://i.imgur.com/oF20zHM.jpg)

Continuing down the line, the sprites appear in sequence, 

![radio code](https://i.imgur.com/Ic1XIle.jpg)

ending in a cool pair of sunglasses (my favorite touch!). 

![radio code](https://i.imgur.com/295we4t.jpg)
![radio code](https://i.imgur.com/Zi1LNCL.jpg)

### Squiggly Line/Costumes Project

This emulated a more [advanced project](https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/425323424/). Because of this, it was a bit tough, but they made a good start by using the "next costume" trick to change through a series of costumes. 


{% include giphy.html link="https://media.giphy.com/media/Q5dlB0kBckYD20Rgfl/" %} 

If you look at the original project this is exactly what it is, except repeated many times. The original project has 104 costumes!!

<iframe src="https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/418429641/embed" allowtransparency="true" width="485" height="402" frameborder="0" scrolling="no" allowfullscreen></iframe>


These two are both great projects, and worth continuing!!

### Success 3: Mario 

The king of all video games is of course Mario. Another student asked about how to make a character jump like Mario does. There is a simple way:

Of course there are more complicated ways that include moving forwards and gravity and other things, but as a beginning, this is a start.

Another important element of a Mario game is how to move the background. Using series of costumes this can look very smooth, but it takes a while to understand [how to do it](https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/76150/).

<iframe src="https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/76150/embed" allowtransparency="true" width="485" height="402" frameborder="0" scrolling="no" allowfullscreen></iframe>


### Success 4: The Fox Project

The Animate My Name tutorial seems very simple, it has a lot fo room for development. One student patiently followed the tutorial to create an alphabet beatbox. They added a background and the letters FOX. Pressing the letter F made music play, and the other letters changed color when touched.

![play music](https://i.imgur.com/dXcq0qC.jpg)

![change color](https://i.imgur.com/6Lb1kuh.jpg)

We had a lot of fun dancing to the music!!!

This project has room for development. For example, the colors of the characters could change when the music changes. That would be very flashy. The limit is your imagination.

### September 7th Homework and Note to Parents

#### September 7th Homework

1. *On paper* (**NOT IN SCRATCH**) make a plan for a project you want to do in Scratch. 
  For example:
   1. What is the goal of the game/project? How do you succeed? What are the challenges? What is the story?
   2. What are the actions that players can take using the mouse and keyboard? 
   3. What sprites are there? Who are the actors and what are the objects you need?
   4. What backdrops do you need? What are the settings (places) where things happen?
2. (Optional) If you want to work in scratch, make improvements to the Colorful Trails Project. Show me what you can do! Do your best to figure out on your own things such as how to:
   1. Add buttons that do things
   2. Add music and sounds
   3. Add additional movements
   4. Add/Change costumes and backdrops.
   5. Create a second screen?
3. (Optional) There were lots of new ideas last week. It would be a good idea to review (at least the pictures of) what we did in class (below). Can you do everything we covered (see below)? 

#### Note to Parents: Bring a Mouse
Some children struggled using touchpads. I recommend having children **bring a computer mouse** to class.

#### Note to Parents: Install Chrome
Students are using different browsers. To avoid confusion we are wondering, if possible, if parents could **install Chrome** on their child's computer. Here is the [download link](https://support.google.com/chrome/answer/95346). 



### September 7th Class Summary

Today I began with a rough overview of Scratch:

We covered, briefly, how to:
* add a costume to the background and sprites
* save and import a photo.
* make sprites speak
* add music extension
* press a key (`b`) to [change the background](https://i.imgur.com/u2PdPmu.jpg)
![change the background](https://i.imgur.com/u2PdPmu.jpg)
* press a key (`s`) to [play sounds](https://i.imgur.com/K0QXkIn.jpg)
![play sounds](https://i.imgur.com/K0QXkIn.jpg)
* Say words [in different languages and accents](https://i.imgur.com/6dUphu8.jpg)
![in different languages and accents](https://i.imgur.com/6dUphu8.jpg)

A lot of new information, so we will go over all this again as the class continues.

### Making Music 
*Note that sounds and music are different for scratch. Sounds are recorded, music is played.*
#### 1. Add Music Extension
To make music using instruments you have to add [music extension](https://media.giphy.com/media/QTmDHXHASop0qWUDFn/giphy.gif)

{% include giphy.html link="https://media.giphy.com/media/QTmDHXHASop0qWUDFn/" %} 

#### 2. Use the music blocks
Then music blocks appear at the bottom of the block section and you can use them just like the sound blocks:

![play music](https://i.imgur.com/44g6H5Y.jpg)


* remember, the music blocks and the sound blocks are different!!

#### 3. Stopping  and Start
The question "how to make the music stop" came up. One "quick" way to make the music stop is to set volume to zero by [pressing a key](https://i.imgur.com/LkwBOiN.jpg):

![stop music by setting volume to 0%](https://i.imgur.com/LkwBOiN.jpg) 

This doesn't work too well. To do it properly though is a bit difficult!!!! It requires the "[forever repeat until costume trick](https://i.imgur.com/2FneO4Y.jpg)".

![stop music forever repeat until costume trick](https://i.imgur.com/2FneO4Y.jpg)

I will explain this in a future class!

### August 31st Homework:

The homework is to look inside the Colorful Trails Project (see below) and think about:

1. How could we make Colorful Trails more interesting? (e.g. make it slower, add music, etc.)
2. How could we add more characters and backgrounds
3. How to make it so if I press "c" it clears the board.

Here is my [example remix](https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/421636996/). Loot at how I:

* changed the costumes to letters to spell out my name
* added music 
* added buttons to stop and go:

### Intro to Scratch 

Today I gave a basic outline of the scratch website. I explained how to: 

* Find your User ID, Stuff, and mailbox

You can see in the picture below how to get **your profile** page, **your stuff** page, **account settings**, and how to **sign out**. The folder icon (With the orange S) also goes to **your stuff**.


![folder in the upper right](https://i.imgur.com/vN7VHRa.jpg)


* Find the [Jr. Coders 2020 Monday Class Studio](https://scratch.mit.edu/studios/27394220/) 


On your profile page is a section called "Studios I'm Following". I have  added the  [Jr. Coders Monday studio](https://scratch.mit.edu/studios/27394220/) is where I will occasionally post assignments and other items for the class. 

![profile ](https://i.imgur.com/lFK8l6t.jpg)


* Go to My Stuff

The **my stuff** page is where your projects and studios are found. You can see buttons (top right) for creating **new projects**, **new studios**.

![](https://i.imgur.com/ThRgNql.jpg)

* Remix, add to studio, favorite, see inside

From project pages you can:

1. Remix: Make your own copy of a project so you can edit it
2. Add a project to a studio, which is a way of collecting projects you like.
3. Favorite: This is another way to collect projects. This also appears on the **your stuff** page. 
4. See inside: This allows you to look at the code inside a project.
5. Run the project: Click one of the green flags.
6. Stop a project: click the red stop sign.

Kids made a remix of it, and we did a preliminary review of how to:

* create new backgrounds and characters 
* save our projects and the 
* different blocks 
  
without going into too much detail.

### August 24th Homework Review 

We did a brief review of what kids had been working on for the week based on the Walk Though the Forest project. I had planned to work on the Creating Rain Project (as I said last week), I told students that we might transition to using Scratch. The kids were very excited to see what it was like, so that became the focus of the day. 

### Scratch

Scratch is web based. We visited [the scratch website](http://scratch.mit.edu) and by pressing the "Create" button students could start exploring. Kids were very interested in choosing sprites:

and editing sprites:

### Scratch Accounts

To make it easier to manage the student accounts I have created accounts and passwords for each student. These will be send to each student separately. Once you have your login information, [login to the scratch website](http://scratch.mit.edu){: target="_blank_"} using the id and password. 

### Scratch Jr. Coders 2020 Monday Class Studio

Scratch lets you group related projects into Studios. I have created a studio just for the Jr. Coders 2020 Monday Class. For the student accounts I have set them to ["follow" this studio](https://scratch.mit.edu/studios/27394220/){: target="_blank_"}. 

Inside the studio you can see [my Sample Shared Project](https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/420090077/){: target="_blank_"}. We will look at this more closely next class, but here you can see how it looks:

### August 24th Homework 

For the next few weeks we will do a combination of finishing Scratch Jr. and Starting Scratch. The homework is to:

* Finish any Scratch Jr. projects you are working on
* Visit and/or Log into Scratch and start exploring and playing.

### August 17th Review and Homework 

There were only 2 kids today, so we just continued to work on the Walk throught the forest project. The main idea of the project is that the character just continues to walk along on one screen and things come along and happen to him. The extended video below shows what I mean. See how the poison rain comes and he is touched by it. Some ideas of what could happen next:

* A mountain comes and he has to climb it.
* A fairy comes and offers him a glass of water.
* Many flies come and chase him out of the screen into another screen, or into a river.

Add your own!!

### August 3rd Homework Review

As usual, we review the homework. The main goal of the project was to show how to create the illusion of movement using moving characters and screen transitions. 

### Original Project: A Walk In the Forest 
I created the A Walk In the Forest Project to help reinforce that idea. The project creates the illusion of continuous motion by having characters moving continuously behind a fixed character. I showed the students the project and their first challenge was to recreate the project. They had to discover:

* Adding 3 grass elements to the bottom of the screen and having them move right continuously makes it look like the cat is moving.
* Adding several trees also moving makes it look like he is walking in a forest. 

The next stage was making it look like he is coming out of the forest:

* The trees run through a few 20 step loops, one loop for each time across the screen.
* At the end, each tree has to move just the right amount to get to the left edge of the screen before disappearing.
* This takes a little math. They have to find the starting position of each tree, and add just that amount to the motion, then disappear.

### August 10th Homework
The homework is to now make the cat move onto a new environment, such as having rain appear (you can just see it start to happen in the image above), or animals flying. How can you make these appear at just the right moment, and make it seems like the cat is walking through them? Good luck!

Here is a full example. Notice how the clouds appear. For example, another character might appear from the right, and the two characters might fight in the center, then the character could move on.

### August 3rd Homework Review 


We reviewed Flying Project Homework. Some kids used the same background, but some chose a night scene or other scene. Most kids were able to create the first screen with ease, so we moved on to how to create the cool "rising into the sky" effect. 

First we tried it with the kids just looking at the result and trying to code it without any help. Then I helped overcome problems, and gave suggestions on how to improve it.

The transition involves several steps:

1. The [P1 Pilot](#imagegallery2-Y2R13Flying-P1_Pilot) is touched and he rises to the top of the screen and disappears. 

2. The second screen appears. the [P2 Pilot](#imagegallery2-Y2R13Flying-P2_Pilot)  is flying up in the air though the tops of the [P2 Trees](#imagegallery2-Y2R13Flying-P2_Tree3).

3. The key is that this background screen is the *visual continuation* of the screen below it. This creates the effect of rising into the sky.

4. To make the effect clearer, the top of the trees in screen one (these are part of the background) are added to the bottom of screen two (these are characters). 

5. When we get to screen 2, these [P2 Trees4](#imagegallery2-Y2R13Flying-P2_Tree4) go down, making it look like we are rising into the sky above the trees.

6. The effect is better when the trees go down slowly, and disappear at different times. 

7. We spent a lot of time figuring out how to draw [P2 Clouds2](#imagegallery2-Y2R13Flying-P2_Cloud2)   using circles. I didn't quite finish this but explained the basic idea. Drawing a circle with a border covered by a circle without creates the cloud shape in the project.

8. I also discussed how to make small stars by drawing a small line with just two dots and bringing the dots just over each other. This was used by one of the students who was using a night background.

9. You can see how the effect is created in the gallery below.

### August 3rd Homework

Now that we know how to make the "rising up" effect, you can finish making the Flying Project. That is the homework. Can you make the the plane fly up in screens 1, 2, 3, and then back down using screens 3, 4, 1?

* Next class: We work on using the same effect in other ways.
