### September 7th Homework and Note to Parents

#### September 7th Homework

1. *On paper* (**NOT IN SCRATCH**) make a plan for a project you want to do in Scratch. 
  For example:
   1. What is the goal of the game/project? How do you succeed? What are the challenges? What is the story?
   2. What are the actions that players can take using the mouse and keyboard? 
   3. What sprites are there? Who are the actors and what are the objects you need?
   4. What backdrops do you need? What are the settings (places) where things happen?
2. (Optional) If you want to work in scratch, make improvements to the Colorful Trails Project. Show me what you can do! Do your best to figure out on your own things such as how to:
   1. Add buttons that do things
   2. Add music and sounds
   3. Add additional movements
   4. Add/Change costumes and backdrops.
   5. Create a second screen?
3. (Optional) There were lots of new ideas last week. It would be a good idea to review (at least the pictures of) what we did in class (below). Can you do everything we covered (see below)? 

#### Note to Parents: Bring a Mouse
Some children struggled using touchpads. I recommend having children **bring a computer mouse** to class.

#### Note to Parents: Install Chrome
Students are using different browsers. To avoid confusion we are wondering, if possible, if parents could **install Chrome** on their child's computer. Here is the [download link](https://support.google.com/chrome/answer/95346). 



### September 7th Class Summary

Today I began with a rough overview of Scratch:

We covered, briefly, how to:
* add a costume to the background and sprites
* save and import a photo.
* make sprites speak
* add music extension
* press a key (`b`) to [change the background](https://i.imgur.com/u2PdPmu.jpg)
![change the background](https://i.imgur.com/u2PdPmu.jpg)
* press a key (`s`) to [play sounds](https://i.imgur.com/K0QXkIn.jpg)
![play sounds](https://i.imgur.com/K0QXkIn.jpg)
* Say words [in different languages and accents](https://i.imgur.com/6dUphu8.jpg)
![in different languages and accents](https://i.imgur.com/6dUphu8.jpg)

A lot of new information, so we will go over all this again as the class continues.

### Making Music 
*Note that sounds and music are different for scratch. Sounds are recorded, music is played.*
#### 1. Add Music Extension
To make music using instruments you have to add [music extension](https://media.giphy.com/media/QTmDHXHASop0qWUDFn/giphy.gif)

{% include giphy.html link="https://media.giphy.com/media/QTmDHXHASop0qWUDFn/" %} 

#### 2. Use the music blocks
Then music blocks appear at the bottom of the block section and you can use them just like the sound blocks:
![play music](https://i.imgur.com/44g6H5Y.jpg)


* remember, the music blocks and the sound blocks are different!!

#### 3. Stopping  and Start
The question "how to make the music stop" came up. One "quick" way to make the music stop is to set volume to zero by [pressing a key](https://i.imgur.com/LkwBOiN.jpg):

![stop music by setting volume to 0%](https://i.imgur.com/LkwBOiN.jpg) 

This doesn't work too well. To do it properly though is a bit difficult!!!! It requires the "[forever repeat until costume trick](https://i.imgur.com/2FneO4Y.jpg)".

![stop music forever repeat until costume trick](https://i.imgur.com/2FneO4Y.jpg)

I will explain this in a future class!

### August 31st Homework:

The homework is to look inside the Colorful Trails Project (see below) and think about:

1. How could we make Colorful Trails more interesting? (e.g. make it slower, add music, etc.)
2. How could we add more characters and backgrounds
3. How to make it so if I press "c" it clears the board.

Here is my [example remix](https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/421636996/). Loot at how I:

* changed the costumes to letters to spell out my name
* added music 
* added buttons to stop and go:

<iframe src="https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/421636996/embed" allowtransparency="true"  width="485" height="485" frameborder="0" scrolling="no" allowfullscreen></iframe>


### Intro to Scratch 

Today I gave a basic outline of the scratch website. I explained how to: 

* Find your User ID, Stuff, and mailbox

You can see in the picture below how to get **your profile** page, **your stuff** page, **account settings**, and how to **sign out**. The folder icon (With the orange S) also goes to **your stuff**.


![folder in the upper right](https://i.imgur.com/vN7VHRa.jpg)


* Find the [Jr. Coders 2020 Monday Class Studio](https://scratch.mit.edu/studios/27394220/) 


On your profile page is a section called "Studios I'm Following". I have  added the  [Jr. Coders Monday studio](https://scratch.mit.edu/studios/27394220/) is where I will occasionally post assignments and other items for the class. 

![profile ](https://i.imgur.com/lFK8l6t.jpg)


* Go to My Stuff

The **my stuff** page is where your projects and studios are found. You can see buttons (top right) for creating **new projects**, **new studios**.

![](https://i.imgur.com/ThRgNql.jpg)

* Remix, add to studio, favorite, see inside

From project pages you can:

1. Remix: Make your own copy of a project so you can edit it
2. Add a project to a studio, which is a way of collecting projects you like.
3. Favorite: This is another way to collect projects. This also appears on the **your stuff** page. 
4. See inside: This allows you to look at the code inside a project.
5. Run the project: Click one of the green flags.
6. Stop a project: click the red stop sign.
![project page](https://i.imgur.com/B5ySkDH.jpg)


### August 31st Sample Projects 

#### Slash Knight 
We opened some sample projects. [Slash Knight](https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/419503825/) was especially popular.

<iframe src="https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/419503825/embed" allowtransparency="true"  width="485" height="485" frameborder="0" scrolling="no" allowfullscreen></iframe>

#### Colorful Trails
Another popular project was the [Colorful Trails Project](https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/10001052/).

<iframe src="https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/10001052/embed" allowtransparency="true"  width="485" height="485" frameborder="0" scrolling="no" allowfullscreen></iframe>


Kids made a remix of it, and we did a preliminary review of how to:

* create new backgrounds and characters 
* save our projects and the 
* different blocks 
  
without going into too much detail.

### August 24th Homework Review 

We did a brief review of what kids had been working on for the week based on the Walk Though the Forest project. I had planned to work on the Creating Rain Project (as I said last week), I told students that we might transition to using Scratch. The kids were very excited to see what it was like, so that became the focus of the day. 

### Scratch

Scratch is web based. We visited [the scratch website](http://scratch.mit.edu) and by pressing the "Create" button students could start exploring. Kids were very interested in choosing sprites: 

![choosing](https://i.imgur.com/ImoUoyE.jpg){: target="_blank_"}

and editing sprites: 

![editing](https://i.imgur.com/NpAvJPh.jpg){: target="_blank_"}

### Scratch Accounts

To make it easier to manage the student accounts I have created accounts and passwords for each student. These will be send to each student separately. Once you have your login information, [login to the scratch website](http://scratch.mit.edu){: target="_blank_"} using the id and password. 

### Scratch Jr. Coders 2020 Monday Class Studio

Scratch lets you group related projects into Studios. I have created a studio just for the Jr. Coders 2020 Monday Class. For the student accounts I have set them to ["follow" this studio](https://scratch.mit.edu/studios/27394220/){: target="_blank_"}. 

Inside the studio you can see [my Sample Shared Project](https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/420090077/){: target="_blank_"}. We will look at this more closely next class, but here you can see how it looks:

<iframe src="https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/420090077/embed" allowtransparency="true" width="485" height="485" frameborder="0" scrolling="no" allowfullscreen></iframe>


### August 24th Homework 

For the next few weeks we will do a combination of finishing Scratch Jr. and Starting Scratch. The homework is to:

* Finish any Scratch Jr. projects you are working on
* Visit and/or Log into Scratch and start exploring and playing.

### August 17th Review and Homework 

There were only 2 kids today, so we just continued to work on the Walk throught the forest project. The main idea of the project is that the character just continues to walk along on one screen and things come along and happen to him. The extended video below shows what I mean. See how the poison rain comes and he is touched by it. Some ideas of what could happen next:

* A mountain comes and he has to climb it.
* A fairy comes and offers him a glass of water.
* Many flies come and chase him out of the screen into another screen, or into a river.

Add your own!!

### Next Project Creating Rain

Once we finish this project we will learn how to make rain.

### August 3rd Homework Review

As usual, we review the homework. The main goal of the project was to show how to create the illusion of movement using moving characters and screen transitions. 

### Original Project: A Walk In the Forest 
I created the A Walk In the Forest Project to help reinforce that idea. The project creates the illusion of continuous motion by having characters moving continuously behind a fixed character. I showed the students the project and their first challenge was to recreate the project. They had to discover:

* Adding 3 grass elements to the bottom of the screen and having them move right continuously makes it look like the cat is moving.
* Adding several trees also moving makes it look like he is walking in a forest. 

The next stage was making it look like he is coming out of the forest:

* The trees run through a few 20 step loops, one loop for each time across the screen.
* At the end, each tree has to move just the right amount to get to the left edge of the screen before disappearing.
* This takes a little math. They have to find the starting position of each tree, and add just that amount to the motion, then disappear.

{% include niceimage-galleryNoTableweserveGifsNoLink.html folder="/images/2020-08-10/" %}


### August 10th Homework
The homework is to now make the cat move onto a new environment, such as having rain appear (you can just see it start to happen in the image above), or animals flying. How can you make these appear at just the right moment, and make it seems like the cat is walking through them? Good luck!

Here is a full example. Notice how the clouds appear. For example, another character might appear from the right, and the two characters might fight in the center, then the character could move on.

### August 3rd Homework Review 


We reviewed Flying Project Homework. Some kids used the same background, but some chose a night scene or other scene. Most kids were able to create the first screen with ease, so we moved on to how to create the cool "rising into the sky" effect. 

First we tried it with the kids just looking at the result and trying to code it without any help. Then I helped overcome problems, and gave suggestions on how to improve it.

The transition involves several steps:

1. The [P1 Pilot](#imagegallery2-Y2R13Flying-P1_Pilot) is touched and he rises to the top of the screen and disappears. 

2. The second screen appears. the [P2 Pilot](#imagegallery2-Y2R13Flying-P2_Pilot)  is flying up in the air though the tops of the [P2 Trees](#imagegallery2-Y2R13Flying-P2_Tree3).

3. The key is that this background screen is the *visual continuation* of the screen below it. This creates the effect of rising into the sky.

4. To make the effect clearer, the top of the trees in screen one (these are part of the background) are added to the bottom of screen two (these are characters). 

5. When we get to screen 2, these [P2 Trees4](#imagegallery2-Y2R13Flying-P2_Tree4) go down, making it look like we are rising into the sky above the trees.

6. The effect is better when the trees go down slowly, and disappear at different times. 

7. We spent a lot of time figuring out how to draw [P2 Clouds2](#imagegallery2-Y2R13Flying-P2_Cloud2)   using circles. I didn't quite finish this but explained the basic idea. Drawing a circle with a border covered by a circle without creates the cloud shape in the project.

8. I also discussed how to make small stars by drawing a small line with just two dots and bringing the dots just over each other. This was used by one of the students who was using a night background.

9. You can see how the effect is created in the gallery below.


{% include niceimage-galleryNoTableweserveGifsNoLink.html folder="/scratchProjects/Y2R13Flying/" %}

### August 3rd Homework

Now that we know how to make the "rising up" effect, you can finish making the Flying Project. That is the homework. Can you make the the plane fly up in screens 1, 2, 3, and then back down using screens 3, 4, 1?

* Next class: We work on using the same effect in other ways.

### July 27th Homework Review 

The Teamwork 5000 Redux homework student made were very interesting and we moved slowly and methodically, so in the end we spent the better part of the entire class giving stars and wishes and debugging. Before running their code, I asked the kids to tell me who their characters were and what happens in each screen to reinforce their project planning and storyboarding. 


### Homework for August 3rd: Flying Project 

I then introduced the Bootup Flying project. 

{% include youtubelazy.html  videoID="YQ62p8WQVS8" %}

The homework is to imitate (using just the video as a guide) *the first screen*, including 4 animals flying, and touch actions for each of them. You can use your own characters and motions, but keep the basic idea.

* Extra credit: try to figure out how to make the transition from screen 1 to screen 2.

### July 20th Homework Review 
As usual we did a homework review. Kids are getting more specific with their comments, which is good.


### Review Things that make projects better (Stars!)

Students Brainstormed a list of things that make for a good project

* Creativity
* Teamwork
* No crazy stuff (it should make sense)
* No violence/killing (Be kind)
* Details 
* Interesting characters and backgrounds
* Make clear who is speaking or acting
* Use word bubble and sounds
* Use color
* Make an exit screen
* Beautiful story
* Navigation buttons


### Teamwork 5000 Redux

By popular demand, instead of doing a new Bootup Project, kids wanted to make another Teamwork 5000 project. Each child came up with some ideas and in the end we had four components for kids to tie together into a story:

* Like a movie
* Look at an angel
* Go to a monster house
* Computer Robots

In class kids did a storyboard, and reviewed it with me. Once it was complete, they started their projects.

### July 20th Double Hangman

Again we ended the class with a game of hangman. This time we played double hangman, with 2 boards going at the same time. Double the fun!


### July 20th Homework

The homework is complete the Teamwork 5000 Redux Project and email it to me.

### July 13th Homework: Diagonal Movement and Alien Planet 

We reviewed the Diagonal Movement Puzzle and Alien Planet Project. In one solution, as in the "P1 Spaceship" in the code for the Alien Planet (below), is to have several green flag blocks that all start at the same time. That means the spaceship moves up and across and shrinks at the same time, that is to say diagonally and away. Another answer to the puzzle was, instead of many green flags, to have the character/space ship send a message to itself, and have several "receive message blocks" do movements or other actions at the same time.  


{% include niceimage-galleryNoTableweserveGifsNoLink.html folder="/scratchProjects/Y1R31Alienplanet/" %}

<!-- 
{ % include niceimage-gallery.html folder="/scratchProjects/Y1R31Alienplanet/" %}

{ % include image-gallery.html folder="/scratchProjects/Y1R31Alienplanet/" %}
-->

#### Stars and Wishes: Common Wishes

We looked at all the projects, and kids came up with Stars and Wishes for the projects. Part of the Here are some common "wishes" for projects. Remember to put them into your next project:

* Draw your own interesting character or background. (For example, using colors and shapes well)
* Make clear who is speaking when there is sound. (For example, have characters move when they speak.)
* Make sure people can follow the action of the story. (Make each action separate)
* Use word bubbles to explain the action.
* Use text panels, like a "The End" screen to carry the project forward.
* Add screen navigation buttons

Kids are getting better at using the drawing screen, and the characters are looking better and better.

### Finish the Alien Planet

Some kids took on the extra credit project and gave the alien various objects. Those that didn't can finish their projects for the homework. 

### July 13th Homework: Naughty/Nice Wizard

The assignment was to take the basic idea of the Naughty Wizard Video and make their own version.The basic story is there is some kind of conflict, and either a naughty or nice wizard is involved in solving it or making it worse.  

First the kids worked on a storyboard. I wanted kids to use the [switching constumes](#switching-costumes) technique we learned two weeks ago when applying the "Wizard"'s magic. 

### July 13th Homework

The homework is:
1. Finish the Alien Planet projects, including making the improvements (wishes) that people suggested in class.
2. Finish you Naughty/Nice Wizard thinking about the "Common Wishes" list above.

### Review Project: "Pass It On"

We reviewed homework projects. Students were very kind in giving out "Stars and Wishes", that is talking about what they liked and would improve in each project.



### Switching Costumes Project

Once common challenge in ScratchJr. is making a character suddenly change. We watched a video about [several ways to do that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jv5r9aafZA&feature=youtu.be). 

{% include youtubelazy.html  videoID="7jv5r9aafZA" %}



We then walked through a project showing two ways to make a character change costumes using the [Switching Costumes Project](./scratchProjects/20200706HidingDisappearing.sjr)

1. Using a new screen

If you place the character at the same place in both screens (at the end of one, and the beginning of the other) they will appear to magically change.

2. Using a message

If you send a message that goes to both characters, you can make one disappear, and the other appear at the same time. 

If you add a 3 "smoke screen" that appears and disappears as the characters change, it can seem like magic.

### The Aliens Have Landed Part 1: *The Space Ship Problem*

We then watched a video describing out next project, "The Aliens Have Landed" from Bootup.

{% include youtubelazy.html  videoID="aCoA8V1nx9Q" %}


#### Space Ship Problem: Diagonal movement

In the beginning of the video the space ship  moves diagonally up and across the screen. I challenged the group to show me how to do it. Kids came up with some interesting suggestions, and eventually we got to a solution (though there is a simpler one: see screen 1 of the Homework). The secret is having both actions take place at the same time in separate "threads".

#### Space Ship Problem: Shrinking Cat

However, in the video, the space ship also gets smaller. How do we do this? One suggestion was made, but the **Red Shrinking Cat** (screen 2 of Homework) doesn't quite work. This is the homework challenge (screen 3).

### Hangman

After cleanup we had enough time for a fun game of Hangman. 

### July 6th Homework

* Download [the Switching Costumes](./scratchProjects/20200706HidingDisappearing.sjr) project to ScratchJr. Do you understand it?

* **Solve the Space Ship Problem** (in screens 3 and 4). [Here is a guide for you to download](./scratchProjects/20200706SpaceShipProblemHW.sjr). It has 4 screens:
   1. **Diagonal Movement** from class, and a simpler one without loops.
   2. **The Red Shrinking Cat** that didn't work. (has loops)
   3. Fix this **Red Cat** to make it not bump. Click the box for a hint.
   4. An example of how to change direction. Can you make the pig do it too?

* **Extra Credit**: Do you see how I made the hint appear and disappear? Can you copy that somewhere?
* **Extra Credit**: Watch the Aliens have landed video (above) and try to make it (without having the source code). What would you give (of yours!) to an alien?

### Review Project: "A Day At the Beach"

We reviewed the A Day At the Beach projects that students completed. It was interesting how each child had their own ideas about a day at the beach. We also reviewed:

* Editing a character with a neck that was too long. We studied how to tap and drag to move sections on a image to a new location.


### Pass It On from BootUp

We watched the Pass it On from Bootup video. This video presents four situations which students are asked to continue. 

{% include youtubelazy.html  videoID="YdNbPbozgnY" %}

Each child chose one project and based on that choice:

* Reverse Engineered the first part based on the video. They were allowed to make whatever changes they wanted.
* Continue the story.

We were unable to download the file from the original site. You may be able to download it from our site: [Pass It On](./scratchProjects/Y1R49Passiton.sjr)

* Making two characters (a pirate and their boat) move together at the same time by using the same message sent to both.

### Hangman

As students worked on the project I demonstrated techniques to solve problems that came up, including a lot of spelling questions. This lead to a rousing game of Hangman. 

### June 29th Homework

Continue working on Pass It On, and send it to my by email.

### Review Collaborative Project: "Teamwork 5000"

First we reviewed student homeworks. 

### Debugging Exercises for "A Day at the Beach"

We did a debugging project. I showed students the [A Day at the Beach Project](./scratchProjects/Y1R47AdayatthebeachMod.sjr) from BootUp ans students had to answer the following questions:

1. Why does the car leave without Scratch Cat?

2. Why do we have two Scratch Cats when the surfboard is left on the beach?

Have students reverse engineer it. Click below for answers.

#### Answers for Debugging "A Day at the Beach"

1. We need to make Scratch Cat hide before the car drives away

2. We need to hide the Surfing cat sprite as soon as the “send red message” block is used, not after

</details>

### Storyboarding

Students then Storyboarded their own day at the beach story. Each student and I reviewed each student's project together to make sure it was complete, and they began to code it.

### June 22nd Homework

The homework is to finish the project and email it to me.

Also, optionally, students can download  [A Day at the Beach Project](./scratchProjects/Y1R47AdayatthebeachMod.sjr)  project and try to debug these two other problems we didn't look at:

1. Why don’t we switch to the third backdrop when Scratch Cat decides to surf?

2. Why doesn’t the crab talk while moving on the screen?

### Review Projects

We reviewed the 3 little pigs projects that were submitted as homeworks. Kids seem to enjoy sharing their work very much, and we also attempted to solve minor problems in class. 

### Collaborative Project: "Teamwork 5000"

Today's main project was to work on a project as a class as a story game. The rules were:

* Each person adds one idea. Each person gives one "step".

Possible "steps" are (rules in parentheses were not actually used):

-   Add character
-   Trigger block + up to 3 actions, for example:
    -   green flag + move right and down and repeat 3 times
    -   touch trigger + disappears
    -   etc.
-   send message and receive message plus 2 actions
-   character says something
-   background and character images:
    -   We make the image together.
    -   Take turns adding strokes or figures.
-   Once step is added it cannot be changed without the original creator's agreement

- You may add to them.
- You may make them do unexpected things...that's okay.
- You may only work with the same character 2 times in a row.

### July 15th Homework: Finish the Project

Everyone had made several contributions. We named the project "Teamwork 5000". The homework is to:

 * [Upload this project](./scratchProjects/Teamwork5000.sjr), and continue it on your own. 
 * You may not take away from the project but you can add to it. 
 * You may only add up to 2 more characters. 
 * You may add a background. 
 * You should try to add new screens and use the same characters again.


### Upcoming Project Preview: Good Wizard Bad Wizard

At the end of class we also previewed the next project after this, "Good Wizard, Bad Wizard".

### June 8th Homework Review

Today we reviewed the 3 Little Pigs Project that students submitted. They were all very creative in their work. We had the chance to do some practice debugging as a group when one of the projects didn't work as expected. It was a great thinking exercise and I think the kids enjoyed it.

### Individual stories

I then gave the students the in class assignment, which was to tell a new story. This time it could be any story they wanted. First students worked with pen and paper outlining the story, then started in on ScratchJr. Some of them based it on stories they knew, some made entirely original stories. As students were working I went around the room and helped them with problems or questions they had.


### June 8th Homework

This week's homework is to finish their Individual Story Project and email it to me.

### Message Mania Part 1

We watched the video about [Message Mania Part 1](#update-to-message-mania-part-1){: .innerlink}

### May 25th Homework Review

We reviewed the homework assignments the kids submitted. They were great and kids enjoy talking about their projects with the class. Kids worked together to fix some problems.

### 3 Little Pigs in ScratchJr

Some kids told their own version of the 3 Little Pigs. The assignment was to plan, on paper, without using ScratchJr, how they would tell the story. This included:

+ Designing the characters and houses
+ Plotting out the actions
+ Writing dialogue

The purpose was to think about the project before actually starting to code it. I reviewed their plans, and when they were ready they started coding. Here is my example of what my plan and first screen look like. See [here](../lessons/3LittlePigsInScratchJr.html) for more information.

### June 1st homework

The homework is:

1. Complete and submit their final project to me.

2. (**DO NOT USE SCRATCHJR. PLANNING ONLY.**) Think about other stories you might want to tell in scratch. Be ready to tell the story in class!

### Homework Review

We reviewed homework. Great work telling me what your stories were about! 

Everyone was using English well. Gambatte! Ooops, I mean Try Hard! ;-)

### Message Mania Part 1

We ran through the Message Mania HW assignment.  The purpose of the HW was to:

* Plan/think about the story before you code it. That is why the assignment was NOT to do it in ScratchJr.

My explanation was poor. I blame Zoom ;-) 

Many children did this: 

* One character has: Green flag, orange message, red message, yellow message.

![Green Flag 3 Messages](./images/2020-05-25/GreenFlag3Messages.jpg){: height="100px"}

What I wanted was:

* Each character has a green flag. No message. Messages will be sent by Buttons.
* Each character receives 3 messages
* Each reactions is a different type

![Each Character Has This in Message Mania](./images/2020-05-25/EachCharacterHas.jpg){: height="100px"}


The purpose of the project was:

* to show that messages can go to more than one character at a time. 
* to continue getting practice coding messages and buttons.
* Clicking a button can make several characters move at once.
* Help some students use Messages instead of Wait buttons to control sequence and timing. 

#### [UPDATE to Message Mania Part 1]
I could see that some kids were struggling with this so I called in the Big Dogs. Here is a video showing what to do. If you have any questions, let me know. 

{% include youtubelazy.html  videoID="WA4_xoRt1r8" %}

[A direct link](https://youtu.be/WA4_xoRt1r) to the video.

### May 25th Homework

* Work on HW I gave you in class (if I did). 
* Continue adding to Message Mania.
* Send me your Message Mania project. 
* Download and install MY SAMPLE Message Mania. Try to understand it and we will work on it next week.

If you don't know what to do, just PLAY with ScratchJr. There is no correct answer! It's all good! 

Ideas: 

* Turn Message mania into a story. What happens next? What is the situation? What is the goal?
* Think about characters/actions you want first. Then code it.
* Send messages to more than one character at a time. Why would you do this?
* Use different color messages to control sequence of events. One character orange. Then red, etc.

### Also Coming Up on June 1st

Do you know the story of the 3 little pigs? If not, try to read it.
