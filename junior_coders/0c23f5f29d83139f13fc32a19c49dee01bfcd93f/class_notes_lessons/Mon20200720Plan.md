### Y2R16Inacave

Why won’t we switch pages when the fish is tapped?
We need to add a “start on tap” block and connect a “send blue message” block to it

Why don’t we go back to the first page when SafariCat is tapped?
We need to use a “start on tap” block instead of “start on bump”

Why don’t we go back to the first page when SafariCat is tapped? 
You may need to zoom in on the code to make this one a little easier to see
We need to use “go to page 1” instead of using “go to page 4”

Why doesn’t the scorpion and snake appear when the boulder is tapped?
We need to broadcast an orange message instead of stopping the sprite
