## Things I learned

[Simple project
](https://www.tynker.com/play/simplest-game/5fb99fa8b93d62646c20bd7f-191106Xn719W7joUyQgm3L5e40vKMk)

### Publishing Sharing confusion

Still haven't figured out how to help a student publish a project within the wider community. I am probably not understanding something, which makes the observed behavior unexpected. Could someone explain the prevailing logic to me?

From student A, to share within class, go to my projects, and hit share. This will allow student A to share within class. This only works for unpublished projects. (so far this is perhaps expected behavior)

Publish is available in the project itself, clicked past the community rules, then save and publish, but haven't been able to find where this published project appears...I published, but cant find it anywhere.

If I click share (student A's project) from teacher's showcase the share link works (i.e. student B can see it from the link). In student A's showcase it works and project page appears.  

From  student B's showcase, the project page doesn't work. Specifically, there no option to create share link, only share within class. Expected. However, it offers a project page link, but if I click it "Oops, it seems our codeblocks didn't connect." appears. Or sometimes, "object no found". Other times it works. 

From another student whose interface is different, somehow, I publish a project. It disappears from my projects! Panic. Only later I figure out it is in a so-called  published tab, which is reached via a puzzling icon of two faces. I can't find the project page or a share link. 

If I open it, it gives it to me. However it is still giving me the publish to community option, but I already did that???? I have no idea where it actually is. 

I tried to make this explanation as specific and coherent as possible. Sorry if it is not the clearest; I had to do a lot of back and forth trying to figure it out.

## Sharing links???

I am unclear how I can share a project link with my students. I know that students can find assigned projects in their classroom page, but what I would like is to give them a url to that project. 

There are actually two different use cases here.

1. As a teacher I create a project. I get the share link.

unexpected behavior 1: If the student opens this without being logged in, and remixes the project, the save button appears green. However at this point the project is not actually saved.

unexpected behavior 2. OK, they then save it. If later they return to their account, it is not there. Why? they never logged in. Tynker should prompt them to login before allowing them to save a project.





## Suggestions

### Make name longer and expandable.


Sort my projects / show id 

change order of actors by dragging or other means in 

open projects in new tab

### Moving student from one class to another

I want to move students and the assigned projects from one class to another. (I want to divide the class into two.)

I can create the new class, and each student can join the new class. No problem.
But I want to move the old assigned projects to the new class. If I reassign a COURSE, like the barbie course, their old progress gets carried along with them. But when I reassign a project I assigned myself, the progress doesn't transfer. Is that at all possible? It would be really nice.

If I unassign a project from a class, it no longer appears in the students classroom lesson area. No problem there. It still appears in my unassigned lessons area. I guess that makes sense. BUT the lesson progress shows that my student opened (well, actually it says completed 100%...boo) the project. This makes it appear that the student's work still appears somewhere, though it no longer exists 

One thing ScratchJr does is automatically add the word remix to the name of a project. THat way I know I am not editing the original project, but a new version. 


### Completed projects don't appear correctly

If I go to a completed project that I saved and modified, from my class completed projects tab, in the completed projects the image of the tab looks one way (similar to when I first opened it), but when I open it, it looks as it was when I last saved it (i.e. it is current). This is confusing because if I am looking for a project I completed, I can't recognize it. In other words, the same project (exactly, they seem to have the same id) appears in two different ways in two places. The little round images with 100% on them ***don't help in any way*** because the 100% is **100% WRONG** because  ***it doesn't in any way indicate 100% of anything, just than I actually opened the project, not any degree to which I saved or modified it in any way!!!***


This is especially annoying as the only way I have of identifying the correct project or the identity of two projects is via the id, which is difficult to locate: 
* The name itself is misleading because projects can have the same or very similar names. If you look at community project or remix trees, this is a frequent obstacle.
* Also, I can only see part of the name in the completed projects area, or even in the opened project (at least without several clicks and mouse operations). (It is not a screen size problem. My screen is very large, though on small screens it is worse.) 
* I have to open the project itself, and this is a nuisance because **there is no way to open projects in a new tab**, which is another big annoyance.
* Being able to sort by name, having a list view, and showing the id would all be useful additions. 
* In the project, I suggest making the name resizable, or at least having it auto-expand on :hover, with option to edit.


The problems seems to be in the completed or assigned projects page. The my projects page reflects the current status properly.


### Debugger is out of sync

Unless you click on the code area. It needs to update...maybe intentional, but confusing...


## Old Annoyances



### Stream instead of chat

### No community tab for teachers 

### No way to comment on projects as in scratch. Especially useful for unfinished or not working projects or for bugs...

### no text to speech 

### going from New IDE to classic and vice versa loses characters

### switching levels makes it seem like the whole project is restarting 

### Too many projects with similar names. 

### Original projects often missing 

### Hard to tell when a projects has a tutorial or not 

### Project page version play from community

### Projects refer to the "Level Editor" in New IDE, but there is no level editor in new IDE 

### Wonder if some classic projects work in new IDE 

### Editor in New IDE has broken or missing functions like flip 

(Actually, it is there, but it is not working apparently.)

### The tutorial editor is very buggy

### If I put in a youtube video in the first page of the tutorial, 

it automatically tells me to start coding, and doesn't have the jump link to the next page of the tutorial. 

That means I can't have an intro video that sets up the project before the tutorial.

### I can't have award change both health and score. 

One can change. Can't be done either in sequence or in parallel. In parallel the order in which the on start blocks were places seems to determing prececdence.

(This may be a programming error on my part???)

### No way to open projects in new tab instead of same tab

### Even if I am logged in I can only remix a project (which I assume creates a new version) on the project page, not edit it (which would change the original version). This is inconvenient.

### Reassigning

I assigned a project to my whole class. It was called: "PLATEFORMER TUTORIAL FOR VIDEO
11/2 HOMEWORK for everyone: Guided tour of a Mario type game..." The project appear in the next up for you tab. A student opens it but does nothing on it. He closes the tab without saving it. It no longer appears in the next up for you tab. The student comes back to the next for you tab and can no longer find the project because it no longer appears in the same place and becomes confused and frustrated. In addition, the project is listed as COMPLETED in both his completed projects tab and my classroom page > lessons tab > lessons progress popup.  I can't unassign the project without unassigning it for the whole class :-( I don't really want to do that.

Okay, I bite the bullet and unassign the project for the entire class. It disappears from the completed projects and my assigned projects pages. I make some changes, change the name to "Homework for 11/2: Platformer Guided Tour and Tutorial", save it, and reassign it https://i.imgur.com/F42vwyL.jpg to the whole class. It does NOT appear in the Next Up for You tab, but REAPPPEARS in the completed projects page with the WRONG NAME https://i.imgur.com/ZEtlzh9.jpg, as well as my lessons tab with the wrong name https://i.imgur.com/3VfjgCl.jpg!!!! It appears as 100% completed in both places! In my projects it has the new name https://i.imgur.com/g8jSmfS.jpg!!!!! I did this twice, same result.

Even if I open it, it shows the old project, not the new one https://i.imgur.com/2qngJhj.jpg :-( That project name no longer appears in my my projects page, and it was from THIS NEW NAME that I assigned it) What you see is NOT what you get.

### There is no direct link to assignments

I want to be able to give out a link to assignments. If I give the link to the project, students are sent to the edit-only view, not the actual assignment.

I want a link that forces the chat/stream to be open as I want to encourage them to chat with me. 

I want the chat to be preshared, so they don't have to click share as they think that if they post (from the bottom) it is automatically shared.
