### Stream instead of chat

### No community tab for teachers 

### No way to comment on projects as in scratch. Especially useful for unfinished or not working projects or for bugs...

### no text to speech 

### going from New IDE to classic and vice versa loses characters

### switching levels makes it seem like the whole project is restarting 

### Too many projects with similar names. 

### Original projects often missing 

### Hard to tell when a projects has a tutorial or not 

### Project page version play from community

### Projects refer to the "Level Editor" in New IDE, but there is no level editor in new IDE 

### Wonder if some classic projects work in new IDE 

### Editor in New IDE has broken or missing functions like flip 

(Actually, it is there, but it is not working apparently.)

### The tutorial editor is very buggy

### If I put in a youtube video in the first page of the tutorial, 

it automatically tells me to start coding, and doesn't have the jump link to the next page of the tutorial. 

That means I can't have an intro video that sets up the project before the tutorial.

### I can't have award change both health and score. 

One can change. Can't be done either in sequence or in parallel. In parallel the order in which the on start blocks were places seems to determing prececdence.

(This may be a programming error on my part???)

### No way to open projects in new tab instead of same tab

### Even if I am logged in I can only remix a project (which I assume creates a new version) on the project page, not edit it (which would change the original version). This is inconvenient.

### Reassigning

I assigned a project to my whole class. It was called: "PLATEFORMER TUTORIAL FOR VIDEO
11/2 HOMEWORK for everyone: Guided tour of a Mario type game..." The project appear in the next up for you tab. A student opens it but does nothing on it. He closes the tab without saving it. It no longer appears in the next up for you tab. The student comes back to the next for you tab and can no longer find the project because it no longer appears in the same place and becomes confused and frustrated. In addition, the project is listed as COMPLETED in both his completed projects tab and my classroom page > lessons tab > lessons progress popup.  I can't unassign the project without unassigning it for the whole class :-( I don't really want to do that.

Okay, I bite the bullet and unassign the project for the entire class. It disappears from the completed projects and my assigned projects pages. I make some changes, change the name to "Homework for 11/2: Platformer Guided Tour and Tutorial", save it, and reassign it https://i.imgur.com/F42vwyL.jpg to the whole class. It does NOT appear in the Next Up for You tab, but REAPPPEARS in the completed projects page with the WRONG NAME https://i.imgur.com/ZEtlzh9.jpg, as well as my lessons tab with the wrong name https://i.imgur.com/3VfjgCl.jpg!!!! It appears as 100% completed in both places! In my projects it has the new name https://i.imgur.com/g8jSmfS.jpg!!!!! I did this twice, same result.

Even if I open it, it shows the old project, not the new one https://i.imgur.com/2qngJhj.jpg :-( That project name no longer appears in my my projects page, and it was from THIS NEW NAME that I assigned it) What you see is NOT what you get.

### There is no direct link to assignments

I want to be able to give out a link to assignments. If I give the link to the project, students are sent to the edit-only view, not the actual assignment.

I want a link that forces the chat/stream to be open as I want to encourage them to chat with me. 

I want the chat to be preshared, so they don't have to click share as they think that if they post (from the bottom) it is automatically shared.
