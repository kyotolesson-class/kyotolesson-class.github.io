## September 25th

### Homework Due October 2nd

The homework is to make a Halloween project using every single block. 

### Daily Routines and Halloween Project

Today we had only one student. The student made a wonderful series of projects devoted to daily routines, such as playing soccer and going to school. The projects showed great mastery of how to:

* send and receive messages*
* create new characters and objects using the picture editor and how to 
* weave these together to tell a story.
