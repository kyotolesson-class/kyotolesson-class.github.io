### Recap for January 22nd


ScratchJr.
  : We looked at some sample projects, and students copied and modified the projects.
  : For example, an aquarium with various fish that moved in various ways. The student worked carefully to make two characters move in sync. 
  : Another student used the touch block to make the player choose between two different levels. 

Cake Decorator
  : Student worked on a cake decorator project. This ```when actor clicked :: events hat ```{: .msb}  block selects the icing to put on the cake by changing the "stamper" costume. The student wanted to be able to unselect the icing, which involved a bit of complicated code. To get a little more understanding of if statements, the student continued working on some releavant Barbie tutorials.
