### Homework due March 1st

Work on your ongoing personal project.


### Recap for February 22nd

Platform with balloons
  : Today we reviewed the "Platform with balloons" project (based on a student project) and I reviewed with the entire class how to set tiles inside Tynker to make a trap for meanies. 
  
Teh meanies are in a trap, but we want to open the trap when the actor collects the ring. We use **the set tile at point** block. We initialize it closed at start, and then we change the tiles to empty when the character is collected.

As a modification, kids each chose a different kind of tile, and you can see the result of the code here.

I then showed how to add a character that speaks when another character approaches. Using and **if** block, we check to see if the distance to the main actor is less than 300 pixels. If so, the character says the message. If he is beyond 300 pixels, we say nothing.

In this case the actor tells the main actor that he has to collect a ring before he can attack the green meanies. Here it is everything in live game action.

How to make a character come to life again
  : A student had an interesting question about how to make a character come to life again. Next week we will talk about two ways to do this, but here is a preview:

Debuggging Tic Tac Toe 
  : Kids then worked on their ongoing projects. The biggest challenge today was in teh Tic Tac Toe game. This required some debugging by the student, and the student was able to figure it out by themselves once I gave a hint as to where the problem code was. Great Job!!
