### Review Project: "Pass It On"


## Switching costumes

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jv5r9aafZA&feature=youtu.be

We will show how to switch costumes.

We walk through two ways ot make a character dis to chancostumes. 

## Using a new screen
If you place the character at the same place in both screens (at the end of one, and the beginning of the other) they will appear toe magically change.

## Using a message
If you send a message that goes to both characters, you can make one disappear, and the other appear at the same time. 

If you add a 3 "smoke screen" that appears and disappears as the characters change, it can seem like magic.

### Hangman

As students worked on the project I demonstrated techniques to solve problems that came up, including a lot of spelling questions. This lead to a rousing game of Hangman.
