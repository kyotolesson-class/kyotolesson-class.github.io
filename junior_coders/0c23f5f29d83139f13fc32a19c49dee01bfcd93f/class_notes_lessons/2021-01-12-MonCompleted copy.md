Individually Assigned.

### Recap for January 11th

Tic Tac Toe
  : A students is working on a tic tac toe game. We talked about how it should be set up, and the student worked on making an introduction and rules. His homework is to create actors for each of the positions and give each 3 costumes (blank, X, O).

Tutorials
  : One child continues to work on tutorials and needed a little help with understanding if conditionals.

Haunted House
  : The Haunted House project hit a few snags as at first, characters kept "falling" when the program started. This is because of 3 things that are each quite difficult to understand:
  
  : * Tynker's confusing and poorly documented "static" and "active" settings. If a player is static, he will not move; he will appear as if he is stapled to the background. If he is active, he gains mass: other characters can bump into him.
  : * Setting the world size to the appropriate number of tiles. If the world is larger than the stage, the stage will be extended (unless the stage is set to stretch, in which case the tiles are there but the image covers it completely). This means that characters can go outside of the stage image. For example, they can fall off screen.
  : * For the stage not to fall, the platform has to be above the center of the screen, as the camera will want to center the main actor, and the platform stops him from moving before he falls below center. The main character in a platform game will fall until he/she hits the either a platform of the bottom of the world. The camera will fall with the main hero, creating the effect that the characters are falling. 
  
  : In practice these interact with each other, and finding the right settings can be a matter of trial and error. By playing with the student's project I was able to find a setting that kept the characters from moving. They key is to create a "blank" or invisible platform that still keeps the player up, but prevents him from falling. The following project shows how it works.

Platform Game
  : Another student continued to make a complex platform game with various platforms, enemies, and even a dead-end trap. While it is easy and fun to just add new characters to shoot at, I suggested making the game more interesting by adding a story to it, such as a goal or endpoint, or an object to collect. Perhaps next week.


Peep and the Big Wide World
  : Another student kept working on her walk through the forest project. She added a butterfly that followed peep, and then created a conversation between Peep and the butterfly. Her homework is to create other scenarios.
