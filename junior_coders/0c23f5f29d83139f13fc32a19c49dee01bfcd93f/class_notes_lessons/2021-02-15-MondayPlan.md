## February 15th

### Homework due February 22nd

Keep working on your class project.

### Recap for February 15th

#### Preliminary Activity

We started off with an activity aimed at prompting some positivity and team spirit. Kids went around the room and tried to say one nice thing about one other person. Even though some kids struggled with this, I think it was helpful at getting them to think in those terms. Based on this I talked the positive qualities the kids in this class have. Then I talked about how these qualities can be part of becoming a good coder. I wanted them also to think of themselves as coders.

Qualities that kids in this class have that are also good for coders
  : Creativity 
  : Energy and Excitement
  : Getting in ideas from many places.
  : Cleverness 
  : Assiduousness 
  : Learning independently.
  : Thoughtfulness
  : Kindness
  : Willingness to ask questions and search for answers
  : Concentration
  : Working through difficulties
  : Focus


#### Project Review of the Day (February 15th)

Today we also started a project review series. At the beginning of each class we will spend some time reviewing a project that someone has made. As a class, we will then modify it to see how it works, and how to make it better.

Today's project was the Space Rush game.

We looked at the code that controls how the Ship moves and adjust ed the the parameters to make the character move faser and more smoothly.

By making how far the ship moves each time larger, the ship moves faster, but less smoothly. By decreasing the wait the ship goes faster.

Likewise for the Monn/Asteroid.

Kids really enjoyed being able to modify the code to see what would happen, especially using "crazy" umbers like zero or 1000000. 

#### Motivation System

To help with motivation in the class I started an bonus points system where kids collect points for positive contributions such as cooperation, teamwork, and concentration and hard work. Ultimately the goal is to add a little fun and a rewards for their had work; given that they are still gaining skills and making mistakes and getting stuck from time to time, the intrinsic rewards of making something work are not as strong.

#### Platformers are popular

This week there was a sudden surge in interest in Platform games. One girl had come up with her own since last week, and another two kids decided to copy her effort!!
