### Recap for November 9th

This class involved a step by step review one student's version "Homework for 11/2: Platformer Guided Tour and Tutorial"

It involved me asking a lot of questions to test and reinforce students' understanding of how to create and modify a platform game. I was really impressed that kids really seemed to understand almost everything they needed tto get started. We did some some troubleshooting for parts of the game that didn'T work as expected, and then added some further modifications, such as a changing background and music.

Inspired by this, kids worked on modifying their own version of the tour and tutorial.
