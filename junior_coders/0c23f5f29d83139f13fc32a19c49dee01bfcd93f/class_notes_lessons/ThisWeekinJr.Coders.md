## Friday
### Sept 16th

Whoever hasn't finished their poster should finish it. Then they should finalize their project. These guys have 2 weeks before showcase, so they may be ready a bit soon, and can start on Hallowe'en Projects if not continuing their current project. 

Hallowe'en Project: 
Must have Intro and Game Over Screen
Can be a game or story. Can be scary, but age appropriate.
Must have Storyboard.
Will do Posters as well, so they must start on Posters & Storyboard first, before coding. 

### **Daifuku**
Maybe do another  poster for a different project?
### **Hiro**
???

### **Keigo**
Finish poster. Clean up project.


### **Miki**
He has done quite a bit, so his poster may be ready.
He should decide when and where to hide/show variables. 
Possibly add an introduction Screen. 
If he is ready for showcase, he can begin ot design his next project.
