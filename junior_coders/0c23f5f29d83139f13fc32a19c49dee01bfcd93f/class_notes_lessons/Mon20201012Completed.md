### Homework for October 19th

The homework for October 19th is complete the Tynker project or tutorial you are working on. Also, I added an assignment to the Tynker class page. 

### Moving to Tynker

Today we introduced Tynker. Some kids did tutorials and did the great job with them!!

Here

Some people looked at different projects and thought about what kind of projects they would like to do and got used to the new interface. This Golf game is popular, and some kids are going to try to modify it. 


### The Tynker Class Page and Homework

In Tynker the homework is kept [here](https://www.tynker.com/dashboard/student/#/my-classes/) or [here](https://www.tynker.com/dashboard/student/#panelCompleted). You can see the assignments. There are some tutorials (optional) at the top, and the weekly/class assignments are at the bottom.

I assigned a Magical Pen Tutorial as homework for everyone. I hope to finish it by the end of next class, though you  can start it at home.
