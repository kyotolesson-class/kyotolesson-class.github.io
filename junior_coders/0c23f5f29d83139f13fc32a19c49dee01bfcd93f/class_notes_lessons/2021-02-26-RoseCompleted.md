### Recap for February 26th

Today we focused on planning. As a group, the class came up with a project. 
1. First we decided on the type fo project, a game. 
2. Setting: The beach
3. Story: Collect candy in the sand, and main actor has to find it.
4. Actors/Actions:
   * Protagonist (main actor): Sheep walks, jumps, digs, picks things up
   * Antagonist(s) (Bad guys):
      1. Insect attacks and bits
      2. Skunk sprays
   * Macguffins (goal)
      1. Good Candy give points:
         * Lollipops
         * Chocolate
         * Gummy Bears
         * Cookies
         * Hi-chew
         * Hot Chocolate
      2. Bad Candy loses points, or send actor back to beginning. 
         * old shoes
         * old chocolate
         * smelly socks
         * smelly lollipop
         * coffee


The kids then started working on programming it. 

ScratchJr.
  : The game was simplified for ScratchJr. For the protagonist, we used a little girl, for the antagonist, we used an Elephant, and for the MacGuffin we used starfish. In addition, we could only have one piece of candy on the screen.

In Scratch Jr. the kids also needed to make a way for the actor to move, so we learned how to create buttons that send messages, as we had done a few weeks ago.

From there, we use bump blocks on the starfish, so that when the girl touches the starfish, the start fish says something, and then we move to the next screen.

The project is underway and should be completed next week.

Tynker
  : In Tynker the focus was on choosing actors. 

Kids worked on making the characters the right size and placing them in various places.

Some kids started coding movement using **when key pressed** blocks

After making the girl moved, the question was how to know if she had found the candy. The **touching?** block:

can be used to send a message to the actor touched. (The break stops the motion of the girl.) Once the message touched is send, the good or bad candy can respond.

We will work on this next week.
