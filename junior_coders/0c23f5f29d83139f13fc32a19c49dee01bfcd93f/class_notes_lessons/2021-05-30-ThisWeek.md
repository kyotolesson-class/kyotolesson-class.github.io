### Junior Coders Beginner's Challenge

Today I introduced the **Junior Coders Beginner's Challenge** [please see this page for details](./BeginnerChallenge.html). The goal is to motivate students  to do the Scratch and Tynker tutorials. Students all began or continued working on their first entries, with most completing at least one tutorial today. Here is a Scratch studio with all the Scratch [Beginner's Challenge Projects](https://scratch.mit.edu/studios/29818873/). 

### Recap for May 31st

Trees
  : Student H worked on several projects today, including the following. He created an illustration for his Tree project of a tree sprouting.

He also created a sound project using musical sprites and learned how to make the music stop before playing the next sound.

```
when this sprite is clicked
stop all sounds
play sound (this sound)
```

Dancer
  :Student A's first entry for the challenge was this remix of the "Getting Started" Tutorial.

Pong Tutorial
  : Student A2 did the Pong tutorial. Her modification was adding a game over message, and adding sound and stopping the sound when the game was over. 

```
// ball make sound
when @greenFlag clicked
change [Score v] by (0)
forever
    play sound [Dance Funky v] until done
end

// stop music and say game over
when @greenFlag clicked
forever
    if <touching [Ball v]?> then
        stop all sounds
        say [Game over] for (2) seconds
        stop [all v]
    end
end
```
{: .msb}

{% include zakviewer.html Name="Pong with stops" ID="https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/538651827" caption="" %}


Cow runs away 
  : Student M did the Storytelling tutorial. In his version, the Cow runs away, and there is an alien who hacks at the owl.

Flying Raptor?
  : Student M remixed the flying cat project and is working on adding more characters to it for his Challenge submission.

{% include zakviewer.html Name="Name" ID="https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/538665153" caption="Eventualy the space ships will move." %}


Hacking Scratch Loops
  : Student Y was playing around with the character editor by mangling the basic Flying Cat character. 

{% include imgur.html title="original version" ID="https://i.imgur.com/IWrER1z.png" caption="" width="200px" height="" %}{% include imgur.html title="changed version" ID="https://i.imgur.com/37NeFgv.png" caption="" width="200px" height="" spacer=" "  %}

I showed him how to turn this into a basic animation, and he had a lot of fun hacking an animation"bug" in Scratch. 

```
when gf clicked
forever
next costume
wait (.1) seconds // ballerina

// for other characters 
wait (.e) seconds // cat
wait (.1E1) seconds // man
wait (.01e2) seconds //taco
```
{: .msb}

The ballerina animation is changing every tenth of a second. Usually, Scratch prevents you from putting anything but a number into wait blocks.  However, the student changed the '.1' to '.e', probably by accident. You can see what happened in the cat. As it turns out, Scratch does allow scientific notation, as in '.1e1' to mean .1 X 10^1, or 1. Therefore, aside from the numbers, the letter e is allowed as input. Furthermore, by design or as a bug, it even allows some nonsense values like just plain 'e' or '.E' or 'eeee', which is why the cat works. The taco and the man are flashing at '.1E1' and '.01e2' seconds each, i.e. at 1 second intervals.

### Recap for May 28th

Beach Project
  : Student A learned about layers to help put the bad candy in the basket.

Platform Project
  : I reviewed some corrections Student C's project, including making sure the actor costumes are centered and adding physics and gravity. I will continue to review these with her next week.

Scratch Jr.
  The scratch Jr. Project of the week was The Alien Comes to Visit project. Students K, R, and Y each made different version. Here is one version by student K.

Move Gus
  : Student R made a lot of progress in her fairy chase project based on "Move Gus" tutorial. She finished the first level with one chaser, and moved on to level 2 with more chasers. She included a timer, and signal for when the game is over.

Swordfighting Contest
  : I reviewed with student Y some suggestions for how to bring the characters on stage using animate and glide blocks which he incorporated into his project.
