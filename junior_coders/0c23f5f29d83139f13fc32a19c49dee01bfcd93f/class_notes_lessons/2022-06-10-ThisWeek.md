### Recap for June 13th

Today we continued working on the challenge from last week. 

{% include zakviewer.html Name="2022 6 13 202 06 06 basic game answers remix on Scratch" ID="https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/704521290/" caption="This was the target for today" %}

{% include imgur.html title="" ID="https://i.imgur.com/1DN2wh6.png" caption="Today's challenges: 
- using `when (t v) key pressed`{: .msb} and `when (x v) key pressed`{: .msb}  to turn 15 degrees
- center the backdrop using `go to x: (0) y: (0)`{: .msb}  and centering the costume (reinforcing cartesian coordinates)
- use `when this sprite clicked`{: .msb} to say hello when a face is clicked
- and the big challenge: use `broadcast ( v) and wait`{: .msb} and `when I receive ( v)`{: .msb} to stop other faces saying hello, then making the first say hello. This was a real challenge, but a good way for them to see how broadcasts work." width="" height="" spacer="" %}
