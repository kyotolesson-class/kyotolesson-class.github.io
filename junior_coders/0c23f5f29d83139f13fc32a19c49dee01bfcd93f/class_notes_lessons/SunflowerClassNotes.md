Student Y was unsatisfied with the project he had begun last week. His main task today was to find a project. After considering making a boxing project, then a horse racing project, at the end of class he decided to try making a maze.

Demons
  : Today I worked closely with student M to upgrade his Demon project. 

{% include imgur.html title="" ID="https://i.imgur.com/KWPTNuZ.png" caption="First I slightly rewrote his code to use the broadcast and wait model." width="" height="" spacer="" %}

{% include imgur.html title="" ID="https://i.imgur.com/MH4Osip.png" caption="Then we made all the Demons disappear once we have selected one. I also showed him how to use a variable to keep the one we clicked showing. " width="" height="" spacer="" %}


{% include imgur.html title="" ID="https://i.imgur.com/NDT7LgH.png" caption="Given his project goals, it turns out he would have to copy any changes into each of his 9 demons.

{% include imgur.html title="" ID="https://i.imgur.com/2hoYe1g.png" caption="He chose the first and I showed him how to collect his demon costumes into one sprite (Demons), a slightly time consuming process." width="100px" height="" spacer="" %}

Sunglasses
  : Student H1 worked independently to create a "Chase the Glasses Game". 
  
{% include zakviewer.html Name="2022-03-28 looking for eyeglasses" ID="https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/553913239/" caption="The project uses when arrow clicked blocks to let a funny cat chase a pair of sunglasses.This game showed progress and independent learning compared to his other previous projects.

Bowser
  : Student H2 continued working on his Bowser ScratchJr. project. He posed several challenges.

{% include imgur.html title="" ID="https://i.imgur.com/gaBAC3x.png" caption="I helped him make Bowser fall until he hit the platform." width="" height="" spacer="" %}

{% include imgur.html title="" ID="https://i.imgur.com/KcSTS2H.png" caption="We used a bump block to detect the touch, and a stop block to stop the downward motion and turn it into upward motion. " width="" height="" spacer="" %}

In ScratchJr. this is only partly possible, because it only detects it the first time through the loop. In Scratch this can be programmed quite efficiently. He is asking the right kinds of questions to move on to the next level. After that he made Bowser float above a bridge, reusing code from another previous project.

### Recap for March 12th
Today I shared with the kids a collaborative project idea made by  the monday group. I showed them the original collaboration steps, and the final product. Then we quickly make our own collaborative project idea. 

At the end of class, I showed them a quick mockup of how the project would look.

{% include zakviewer.html Name="2022-03-12 Collaborative Project" ID="https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/658675972/" caption="" %}


Student Y changed his mind a few times about what project he wanted to make, giving up on the project he storyboard from last week. On the 3rt try he found something he really liked, Blade themed fighter project, and we walked through the storyboard process together. We put labels on the characters, and described the action and I helped him write them as steps in the storyboard. The result is a very detailed description of an interesting project. 


Student N ghost project had changed a bit since he storyboarded it, and while his computer was updating we walked through making a new storyboard, emphasizing adding descriptions to each frame for the action. 

Student M continued working on his storyboarded Ghost Bassters project, mostly gathering characters for it. Also, inspired by the class collaborative project, he made this interesting project.

{% include zakviewer.html Name="2022-03-15 CRAZY" ID="https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/550356223/" caption="" %}

Student H continued pushing the envelope while working on his excellent Mario/Bowser project. His coding challenge was that he came across a rare situation where a bump block only triggers once. This is because technically you should put a red stop block at the end of stacks, but in most cases scratchJr. runs fine without it. In fact, this is the first time I have ever seen it affect a project. 


Today's KID'S FAVORITE:

ScratchJr.
  : Student H and I reviewed his homework, the storyboard for his Mario Project. He added some labels to better explain the story.

{% include niceimage-galleryNoTableweserveGifsNoLink.html folder="/images/2022-03-05-ScratchJr/" %}

He began working on the project. I showed him how to change the dimensions of the pistons so they could up and down without showing at the top.Then we used messages to make mario go back when hit by the first piston, but die when hit by the second piston. We tried to hide Mario when he fell, but realized that this would trigger a bump block. ALl in all a great job problem solving and learning about the limitations of SratchJr.

Today the class began a new Project Cycle/Contest. We reinforced expectations for class time and looked at the parts of Project Checklist/Storyboard for the Cycle.

{% include zakviewer.html Name="2022-02-27 2022 02 Project Cycle Challenges" ID="https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/650291488/" caption="We reviewed the the full project cycle. First we discussed the Cycle Grading Scheme. Next we see how class time will be structured in the Cycle. This is only a slight modification of our current scheme. We
then reviewed the Project Checklist/Storyboard." %}

We made titles and talked about the goals of our projects. Then we looked at some example [Storyboards](./../lessons/Storyboards.html), and the homework for next week is to think about the storyboard for your project. This is the crucial step and we will work on it slowly next week.

Student H2 finished the first screen of his BootUp "Naughty wizard project". As an exercise in controllin the position of sprite during a screen transition, I then gave him a new situation for the second screen: Some people are on the beach and the wizard makes it become winter. He was able to complete this on his own and will probably go to a new BootUp project next week.

Scratch
  : Today I assigned students a new assignment. The goal of the project is for student to demonstrate their creativity, skill, and recent progress in learning Scratch. Projects will be collected and showcased in the class notes. The Guidelines for this project (below) are aimed at developing concentration and focus, coding skills, as well as creativity and originality.

  : After reviewing the guidelines, the students began choosing and designing their projects.

{% include zakviewer.html Name="2022-02-12 Untitled-39 Student M" ID="https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/643238190/" caption="Student M chose a basketball project.

{% include imgur.html title="" ID="https://i.imgur.com/XsxEfrv.png" caption=" and if you click the team, these teams disappear. A very good beginning sequence to a game." width="" height="" spacer="" %}



After the break, the students worked on various individual projects of their choice.

2022 Rubric 1 (Sunflower Class)
  : This is an *informal* set of *goals* for this project. The first rule is the most important as this particular class has difficulty seeing projects through to the end.

0.  - [ ] Once you have chosen a project, you may not change projects.
1.  - [ ] Work on this project from start of class to first break. 
2.  - [ ] Add at least  20 blocks each day.
3.  - [ ] Intro screen with Name of project.
4.  - [ ] Sprites must have meaningful names.  
5.  - [ ] Must broadcast messages. Messages must have meaningful names. You must have one message that goes to more than one sprite. 
6.  - [ ] There must be a score. 
7.  - [ ] You must ALL the blocks given in the [sample project](https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/643205095/). 
8.  - [ ] It must be appropriate.
9.  - [ ] You must work on it alone. It must be your own work. 
10. - [ ] I will give Bonus Points for effort, creativity, and completeness. You must collect a least 100 bonus points. I will take points away for lack of effort.
11. - [ ] I am the final judge.


Scratch Jr. 
  : Student H showed me his homework, wherein he made the player fall into a lake if he loses the game. Very clever. I showed him some video of projects from the Bootup Curriculum, and he began working on making the "Naughty Wizard" project.

Scratch Jr. Minecraft Travel
  : Student H2 worked on a Minecraft inspired Travel Game. This game is an intro to the Pull-up technique used in platformer, where one character is falling, but hits a platform that pushes it back up using message blocks. He also learned the hidden sprite technique for detecting the bumps and causing reactions, such as Win Screens appearing. I also taught him how to take pictures using the camera tool so he could make his favorite Octonauts character the hero. He created a story for when the character dies which is his homework to code.

### Recap for January 22nd

In the first half, Students Y and M were eager to emulate the popular Monster Hunter game in Scratch. This is quite a challenge and they began by looking for characters they could use.
