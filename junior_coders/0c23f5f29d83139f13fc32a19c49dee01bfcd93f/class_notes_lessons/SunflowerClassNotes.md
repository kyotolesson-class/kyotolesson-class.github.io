### Recap for February 26th

Today the class began a new Project Cycle/Contest. We reinforced expectations for class time and looked at the parts of Project Checklist/Storyboard for the Cycle.

{% include zakviewer.html Name="2022-02-27 2022 02 Project Cycle Challenges on Scratch" ID="https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/650291488/" caption="We reviewed the the full project cycle. First we discussed the Cycle Grading Scheme. Next we see how class time will be structured in the Cycle. This is only a slight modification of our current scheme. We
then reviewed the Project Checklist/Storyboard." %}

We made titles and talked about the goals of our projects. Then we looked at some example [Storyboards](./../lessons/Storyboards.html), and the homework for next week is to think about the storyboard for your project. This is the crucial step and we will work on it slowly next week.

### Recap for February 19th

Some absent kids today, but for those that were here: 


{% include zakviewer.html Name="2022-02-21 looking for eyeglasses on Scratch" ID="https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/553913239/editor/" caption="Though he spent most of the class playing Scratch games, in the end Student H1 made this simple program that keeps score of how many times you touch the sunglasses. " %}

{% include zakviewer.html Name="2022-02-21 Untitled-39 on Scratch" ID="https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/643238190/editor" caption="Student M continued his basketball project using glide blocks and various when key pressed blocks (space, up arrow, down arrow, a) to control the baskteball." %}


Student H2 finished the first screen of his BootUp "Naughty wizard project". As an exercise in controllin the position of sprite during a screen transition, I then gave him a new situation for the second screen: Some people are on the beach and the wizard makes it become winter. He was able to complete this on his own and will probably go to a new BootUp project next week.

### Recap for February 12th

Scratch
  : Today I assigned students a new assignment. The goal of the project is for student to demonstrate their creativity, skill, and recent progress in learning Scratch. Projects will be collected and showcased in the class notes. The Guidelines for this project (below) are aimed at developing concentration and focus, coding skills, as well as creativity and originality.

  : After reviewing the guidelines, the students began choosing and designing their projects.

{% include zakviewer.html Name="2022-02-12 Untitled-39 Student M" ID="https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/643238190/" caption="Student M chose a basketball project. In addition to procuring images and editing them to remove the backgrounds, he added code to make the basketball appear when the space key is pressed." %}


{% include zakviewer.html Name="Soccer Student Y" ID="https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/643221453/" caption="Student Y made great progress on a soccer game (not a baseball game, despite the background). He had a clear idea of how he wanted the game to start.  " %}

{% include imgur.html title="" ID="https://i.imgur.com/bNjmORu.png" caption="He made players for both sides, as well as a play button to start the project. " width="" height="" spacer="" %}

{% include imgur.html title="" ID="https://i.imgur.com/XsxEfrv.png" caption=" and if you click the team, these teams disappear. A very good beginning sequence to a game." width="" height="" spacer="" %}



After the break, the students worked on various individual projects of their choice.

2022 Rubric 1 (Sunflower Class)
  : This is an *informal* set of *goals* for this project. The first rule is the most important as this particular class has difficulty seeing projects through to the end.

0.  - [ ] Once you have chosen a project, you may not change projects.
1.  - [ ] Work on this project from start of class to first break. 
2.  - [ ] Add at least  20 blocks each day.
3.  - [ ] Intro screen with Name of project.
4.  - [ ] Sprites must have meaningful names.  
5.  - [ ] Must broadcast messages. Messages must have meaningful names. You must have one message that goes to more than one sprite. 
6.  - [ ] There must be a score. 
7.  - [ ] You must ALL the blocks given in the [sample project](https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/643205095/). 
8.  - [ ] It must be appropriate.
9.  - [ ] You must work on it alone. It must be your own work. 
10. - [ ] I will give Bonus Points for effort, creativity, and completeness. You must collect a least 100 bonus points. I will take points away for lack of effort.
11. - [ ] I am the final judge.


Scratch Jr. 
  : Student H showed me his homework, wherein he made the player fall into a lake if he loses the game. Very clever. I showed him some video of projects from the Bootup Curriculum, and he began working on making the "Naughty Wizard" project.

Scratch Jr. Minecraft Travel
  : Student H2 worked on a Minecraft inspired Travel Game. This game is an intro to the Pull-up technique used in platformer, where one character is falling, but hits a platform that pushes it back up using message blocks. He also learned the hidden sprite technique for detecting the bumps and causing reactions, such as Win Screens appearing. I also taught him how to take pictures using the camera tool so he could make his favorite Octonauts character the hero. He created a story for when the character dies which is his homework to code.

### Recap for January 22nd

In the first half, Students Y and M were eager to emulate the popular Monster Hunter game in Scratch. This is quite a challenge and they began by looking for characters they could use. Though they made start of it, I think they realized it would be a very difficult challenge but they seemed committed to doing a project together. At the end of class we talked about it together and we will try ot make an easy Minecraft project next time.


{% include zakviewer.html Name="2022-01-22 Untitled-175" ID="https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/632238103/" caption="Student Y chose some characters. I showed him how to remove backgrounds with pixlr, and he made a start/play button.  " %}
