### Recap for January 22nd

In the first half, Students Y and M were eager to emulate the popular Monster Hunter game in Scratch. This is quite a challenge and they began by looking for characters they could use. Though they made start of it, I think they realized it would be a very difficult challenge but they seemed committed to doing a project together. At the end of class we talked about it together and we will try ot make an easy Minecraft project next time.

Miraculous: Tales Of Ladybug & Cat Noir
  : Student K1 began making two projects based on the popular kids' show "Miraculous: Tales Of Ladybug & Cat Noir". She mentioned she wanted to make some kind of transition in the characters, but the idea is not fully developed.

Celestial Bodies
  : Student H worked on an original project on the stages of a day, with a Sun and Moon crossing the sky. He asked an interesting question: Does the moon move at night? This led to an interesting exploration and discussion of how the sun, moon, and earth move in the sky.
