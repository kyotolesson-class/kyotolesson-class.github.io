### Recap for January 8th, 2022


Christmas project
  : Today, the first thing we did was look at comments other scratchers left on our Christmas Projects page. We helped kids read the comments and post a simple reply, such as thank you.

Individual Projects
  : Kids then worked on new projects.

### Recap for December 18th

Today Students all worked on finishing their Christmas Projects. Then we showed them (with the help of a tutorial video how to join the [STAGE 1 Jr\. Coders Christmas Contest 2021](https://scratch.mit.edu/studios/30730290/):

{% include zakviewer.html Name="SUBMISSION instructions for the 2021 JCCC Jr\. Coders Christmas Contest on Scratch" ID="https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/612642387/" caption="In the next few weeks their projects will be review by some guest commenters (some of my Scratch friends) and the kids will get some positive feedback from them, as well as some follows. Some of the best projects will go on to be features in the Jr. Coders 2021 Christmas Showcase.
" %}

Such competitions are a popular feature in Scratch, and today was a gentle introduction to these and other Scratch social features. The hope is it will motivate them to make better projects by having them think about others looking at their projects.

### Recap for November 20th

Christmas Project 
  : Today I gave the kids an Christmas project assignment. The project is intended as an assessment of their progress in the class, so it would help me if parents could encourage children to do their best on this project. The project must include the following elements (and related  skills): 

1. - [ ] Must be appropriate to the theme of Christmas and the interesting creative and original

2. - [ ] Include sounds on start and on click (sound block)
 
1. - [ ] Change appearance of characters on events (Looks size and costume block)

3. - [ ] Have sprite speak (Say block)

 
2. - [ ] Have a recorded message on key press (record, play, when key pressed)

4. - [ ] Have 2 different Sprites doing 2 different motions at same time (switching sprites)
 
3. - [ ] Change the background and sprites in that background (backdrop change)

 
4. - [ ] Have a Sprite jump 5 times using glide (Glide, x and y position, repeat loops)

5. - [ ] Have a drum play 3 different beats and change color each time it changes beats (sound, color effects)

6. - [ ] Pick a dancing sprite and change the costume to make it look like they are dancing (import costumes, change costumes)

Some samples, so far.

### Important notice

It is important for the safety of your children that we have written notice if anyone other than a guardian/parent is to pick up or take responsibility for your child at pickup time. This includes having the child wait with them until you arrive. Please be sure to tell us (in writing, e.g. via line) if you wish to allow someone to pickup or take charge of your child. 

### Recap for November 13th

Mazes
  : Students K1 and K2 worked on making maze games in Scratch. This is a copy of a project we made in ScratchJr., so it helps them reinforrce prior learning, and also understand the similarities and diffferences between the two platforms. 

ScratchJr. Maze
  : Student H1 finished his road crossing game and then worked on a harder version of it using roads that crossed. It includes making one character disappear while making another reappear as well as raising the question of how to time the motion of the cars so they don't hit each other (actually impossible in ScratchJr., but we can get close.). He then became interested in making the maze game as well, but in ScratchJr. 

Minecraft
  : Students Y & M have an idea for using Minecraft Bats and Dragons in a project. They were able to find images for the project, but they were in an unusual format, so it took some time taking screenshots of the images so they could be imported into Scratch.

Jump Jump 
  : Student N made an platformer project for his Abu character. This was an original project without borrowing code, and demonstrated aan understanding of character movement, user input, conditionals, and broadcasting. 

{% include imgur.html title="" ID="https://i.imgur.com/Y2xdcG6.png" caption=" He learned how to make lava and how to make a game over (backdrop 4) screen when the character hits the lava. " width="" height="" spacer="" %}

### Recap for October 30th

A Day in the Life 
  : Student Y designed a "Day in the Life project in detail, including actors, scenes, and actions. He began designing the first background. After being unable to find a preset background he liked, he drew his own on paper. He tried to trace it using a drawing tablet, but found it was easier to draw it in the the scratch editor using squares and other shapes. The result was quite good, and exactly what he had in mind.


{% include zakviewer.html Name="A Day in the Life 2021 10 30" ID="https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/592280068/" caption="" %}

Squid Game

{% include zakviewer.html Name="Solar Panel 2021 10 29 on Scratch" ID="https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/593628239/" caption="" %}

Kanna 
  : Student K1 was very productive working on tutorials in Scratch. She made a Halloween project (with sounds), a Balloon Popping project (with 2 balloons), and an Underwater Starfish Chase (with a score). She needed some encouragement in modifying or going beyond the basic tutorials.

Squid Game 1
  : Student Y worked on making the player's eyes open and close and the button flash from red to green. He also added and edited the music. He originally tried a first person viewpoint, but settled for this top iiewpoint version.

Scratch Mario Multilevel Game
  : More details have emerged about player H's project. He is making a multi-stage Mario-like platformer. He's made overworld maps and sub-levels. In ScratchJr. each project only has 4 screens, so he's building his game over several projects, each corresponding to a different "land" such as a desert level and a haunted house level.

Electricity Shop
  : Student R's focus continues to be make a shop for people to buy various ways of using or gaining energy. He's setting up the project so that when the shop backdrop appears, all foreground items hide. And when the backdrop changes, all foreground items appear again.

Tower Defense/Battle Cats
  : Some students are still looking for a project to do. Student K2 began working on a Tower Defense project. His focus was on learning how to use the paint editor to make circles and rectangles to put together to make a tank. Student H considered doing a Tower Defense project, but then changed his mind and explored various other potential projects.

The main event today was playing a Collect-a-card Coding Game: 

Collect-a-card Coding Game
  : The purpose of the game is to get kids to demonstrate their understanding of various steps in coding a simple project. The format is as follows:
  
1. Review the target project code. This is not a test, but a game, so kids are taught the code or other answers beforehand. The game is for review.
2. Each student gets 1 or two cards to start with.
3. The teacher opens a blank game, or a game ready to accept the target code. 
4. The teacher walks through coding the game and stops to ask questions, such as what is the next step, what does this block do, etc.
5. Students can volunteer to answer by raising their hand with a card in it. If they answer the question correctly they get 2 cards. If not, 1 card.
6. The teacher can also "volunteer" students, for example if no one answers. You get 1 card for a correct answer.
7. Volunteers must wait out 2 turns give others a chance.
8.  Cards for right answers only, but no penalty for a wrong answer.
9.  At the end, (an unspecified number of) cards gets rewards, such as YouTube time. The number is based on the collective level of input. 
10. Those who were volunteered can ask for help but costs them their card. The card for a correct answer goes to person who helps.
11. Top volunteers may get an additional prize based on effort, original contribution, or other criteria.
12. Prizes include in-class YouTube time, select from the toy box, candy, or negotiable prizes. Often students will defer getting any prize.

The target game for today was Flappy Cat game, part 1. Everyone participated and did a good job of playing along and answering questions. After that, kids continued working on existing projects as usual.

We played a game based on a lecture by [Professor 井本陽久](https://logmi.jp/business/articles/322794).
The game is very good for teaching logic, independent thinking, and other useful skillls. Thought they could understand the basic idea, it was a little bit difficult, so after a while we stopped and had a break and then we went on to individual projects. 

* Student Y worked on a few projects. We worked on finding costumes for his roadblocks hero project and he also worked a little bit on his Battle Cats project. 
* Student M started making a flappy bird project and completed  the first two steps. 

{% include zakviewer.html Name="Flapy Bird" ID="https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/581606705/" caption="" %}

* Student K worked on telling a story in ScratchJr. 
* Student H in Scratch Jr. continued working on his multi project game. He was eager to give me a full explanation of what he intends, and he demonstrated his progress so far. It was clear that he has mastered many skills, such as using buttons to control characters, and different kinds of transitions between scenes. He has developed a solid foundation, and is eagerly exploring all the consequences of what he has learned in various ways.

Student N completed his own basic Flappy bird project and we talked about how to make it better, such as adding levels or obstacles.

Student K1 began her first journeys into Scratch by completing her first tutorial, a chase game. 

{% include zakviewer.html Name="Chase Game" ID="https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/574941151/" caption="She did a great job learning about 'change x' and 'if touching' and 'adding variables'." %}


Student H1 studied various projects in search of inspiration for his next project. 

Student R made the players of his Solar Panel game able to buy more panels when they had enough coins. He was able to figure out the code himself but needed a little help transferring a color from one character to another. 

{% include zakviewer.html Name="Untitled\-5 \(9\)" ID="https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/572503120/" caption="" %}

ScratchJr.
  : Students K2 and H2 worked on their own projects this week. 


Student H1 continued developing his multilevel game in Scratch Jr. He has many original ideas and worked well independently and joyfully.


Student K2 worked on an original project idea I am calling his "Policeman"  project. After some trial and error, I figured out he wanted to make more squares appear when the policeman bumped into some squares. He understood what he wanted and was almost able to get it on his own. With a little tweaking we were able to get it to begin to work, and will continue next week.

Basic Scratch
  : Today, for the elementary level Scratch students there was a lot of interest in racing games and Mario Athletic (Sky) games. Kids mostly tried looking for projects they could do together, but interests diverged, so there was a tendency for kids to distract each other. Next week some different seating arrangements may help with this. 

Solar Panel 
  : This week a lot of progress was made on this advanced level Scratch project. Since the student is a capable and independent coder, our teacher Alex spent some time looking at the student work and making small suggestions on improving the game design, such as developing other things for the money the player collects  to be spent on and adding visual feedback and effects.

ScratchJr.
  : The ScratchJr kids worked mostly on mazes. For one kid demonstrated how to make a square maze, and for other we worked on a Dragon Maze. Mazes are good for teaching using messages and various motions and Looks blocks. There was also a Street crossing game

Today we worked a group on a very basic platformer project based on a project called Grey.  It includes only the essentials, but it introduces concepts like variables, My Blocks, if blocks to detect keypresses, gravity,  and "pulling up out of the ground" particle physics, and even a little tutorial on drawing triangles. This project forms the basis of most platform and scrolling projects and can be easily modified to suit almost any project.

Several announcements:
  : The class notes for last weekend are on the website. We have had a lot of makeup classes recently, and, to avoid confusion, let me explicitly state that class notes for your child's makeup classes are on the page for their usual class, not for the day they attended. For example a Monday student who attends a makeup on Friday will have any notes relevant to him/her on the Monday Page. 

  : Since we are heading into another Emergency Period, we will be strictly enforcing our Covid guidelines around hand washing, social distancing and mask wearing, etc. If you could remind your child these are important rules and of the need to cooperate with them that would be helpful. In addition, seating and snack times will be staggered accordingly.

  : We are pleased that for the most part students are focused and attentive during class, and with their cooperation we are creating a fun, relaxed, yet productive learning environment. However, to maintain this, it would be a good time to remind your child that the main activity in class should be working on assignments and projects, i.e. learning to code. I want to avoid ending the day with a child not having made any tangible progress.  Exploring games and playing them, while educational and part of our goal, is better done at home.

  : (To clarify: We do encourage students to explore the many games that Scratch and Tynker make available, and investigating and hacking other projects is a valid part of learning. We also understand the temptation to play them in class is very strong. However, this can easily become a distraction (for them and others) and a gentle reminder from parents would help me better keep these factors in balance. We do provide free time during breaks, and this is not meant as a ban, but a reminder.)

  : Lastly, our class policy is that students should make an effort to communicate, even amongst themselves, in English, as much as practicable, especially during the first section of class. We understand the limitations around this, but we want to be sure this expectation is clearly understood by all so that we can help support them with this.

Student N and Y made a first steps towards Cat World War (にゃんこ大戦争) games. TThis game starts out with the player clicking boxes to make "soldiers" appear. In the game the soldierss fight each other and you get points if you kill them all or reach the other team's base. This project by Student N is a very good beginning.

Student R is working on an Electricity project. Today we worked on improving the code that makes how the clones are created. Unfortunately creating a clone within a clone creates an infinite loop, and there doesn't seem to be an easy way around that, so we had to give up. Deciding that perhaps he had taken this project as far as possible, we gave up and he began looking for his next project.

Student N worked on a Red Light project. The player uses the right arrow to move right. First we made the bus reappear at the left when we hit the edge. 

```
when [right arrow v] key pressed
move (10) steps
if <(x position) > (270)> then
switch backdrop to (Blue Sky v) ::looks
set x to (-278)
broadcast [switch v]
end
```
{: .msb}

Then we used a variable ('red bue or yellow') to keep track of the condition of the light, and we detect if we are touching the light while the light is red. If he hits the red light, the game over message appears. 


```
if <<touching (Light  v) ?> and <(red blue or yellow) = (red)>> then 
switch backdrop to (Blue Sky2 v) ::looks

Today we had only 3 students.

Two of the Scratch kids did the Nature Watching project. The fist step is erasing the "binocular" of a solid foreground so that we can see what is behind. Even I had a little trouble doing this until another teacher helped me. Once we had that, the rest of the project proceeded smoothly. We make the binoculars follow the mouse, and then add a game scene that includes various animals moving for us to watch. The student added a play button that dissolves using the ghost effect to reveal the game scene. 


{% include zakviewer.html Name="Nature watching" ID="https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/559297885/" caption="" %}


The other student worked on an electricity game. 

{% include zakviewer.html Name="See inside" ID="https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/555066266/" caption="" %}



Originally his project just sent out various balls that travelled from the anode to the cathode. I suggested he add an element that the player could use to direct the balls. In doing that we noticed that his balls were bouncing off at weird angles because he was turning the balls, not pointing them in a different direction. At first this was a random direction, but I suggested it might look more realistic to have them bounce at the correct angle. However, doing this involves some special math. It is not difficult and next class I will show the the correct formula. 

{% include zakviewer.html Name="2021 08 07  Electricity" ID="https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/559308970/" caption="This modification shows how the balls can be made to bounce. The key formula is 'reflected angle = 2 * angle of wall - direction of ball' " %}

Today we walked through a basic Pacman game. Kids went through it at different paces, with some just completing the first few steps, others nearly reaching the end. However, we will continue with this project as it teaches valuable skills.

{% include zakviewer.html Name="PAC 2021 08 02 class project" ID="https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/557526249/" caption="

This involves

* making the pacman, including 'painting with transparency' 
* making the background and maze
* teaching the pacman to move
* teaching it to bounce off walls
* adding a pill
* initializing the pill and pacman
* teaching the pill to hide when pacman touches it<span>" %}

One notable project was this variation on the classic game:

{% include zakviewer.html Name="Dragon Pacman" ID="https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/557134894/" caption="The dragons are friendly though. Use arrow key to capture the one near the center to see." %}



After that kids worked on their ongoing projects. Kids are developing more confidence and the ability to come up with and develop their own ideas independently, though there is a tendency for kids to also get lost playing games rather than coding. The fact that they are enjoying Scratch and engaged with it is great, and we will try to encourage a healthy balance between exploring and creating!

Today we had only 2 students. Student H worked on the Chase Game tutorial. He was very creative in modifying the cat character, and made a rather fun project.

{% include zakviewer.html Name="looking for eyeglasses" ID="https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/553913239/" caption="He also added a score for each time the cat caught the glasses." %}

Student R and I had an extensive conversation about the [Tech Kids Grand Prix](https://techkidsschool.jp/grandprix/), which he plans to participate in. We discussed the basic criteria of the contest, Vision, Product, and Presentation, and I told him that first we will work on Vision. This is the moment where we seek inspiration and creativity to create an original and inventive project. 

One way to do this is to look at what other people have done, and he looked at several projects by other participants. Then I asked him to critique the projects, to develop his analytical ability and help him be able to see projects from an outside  point of view such as a judge or a player. I asked him to rate the projects according to the contest criteria, and then we focused on what he particularly liked about one project. Then we decided to build our own test project that would include these qualities. 

To come up with a theme for this test project, I encouraged him to come up with a topic that is interesting and inspiring for him. This led him to suggest electronics. After asking him to tell me a little about this, we talked about what is electricity. With some improvements for realism, we had a basic model of electricity in a wire, and we then began to develop how this could be a game. We made a rough mockup of the screen, and then once we were happy with that, I gave him the homework of making a more accurate mock up. We talked about how the user would interact with the game, and what the object of the game would be.

All in all, in one class, we were able to run throught the basic first steps involved in creating an original project. The test project is not intended as his final project, but I think it will help him understand the steps that help take something from nothing, to first idea, to first model, to first prototype. This was a great first step and he did a great job moving through it though we were going rather quickly.

Student N began a version of pacman. He made little munching characters, and we worked on drawing a maze for the background. We also made the main actor move right and left, and then blocked its motion when it reached the edge so it wouldn't fall of the edge.

{% include zakviewer.html Name="Untitled\-43" ID="https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/553917616/" caption="" %}

Student M learned how to change the position of the actors using the x and y boxes in the actor area. This was necessary because he couldn't drag his characters because part of his game codes them to disappear if touched. 


Student R started planning a Minecraft quiz game. We talked about learning to plan on paper before trying to code, which he began to do. I also helped him import some images from the web that couldn't be copied the usual way. 


Student H worked on importing characters from other projects into his project.

Kids also enjoyed coding and playing at a video sensing project and a Jelly project. I showed them a simplified version, and perhaps next week we will try to code it together.

Soccer Game
  : During the makeup class for student R, I showed him how to clean up his project by combining stacks. Instead of several green flag stacks and several forever loops, we combined them all. The next day we worked on finishing the soccer game level. One problem was that the ball would get stuck in a corner sometimes; we prevented this by moving the ball away when it touched the goalkeeper. 

{% include zakviewer.html Name="Soccer Game" ID="https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/530891031/" caption="We also made the ball return when a goal is scored. I also showed him how to use a repeated move block to make the ball glide. This helps make recording goals and deflections work better." %}

Clickers
  : A popular game this week was a clicker game, which several students played or worked on. These are very simple. Just click until you drop. Simple, but popular.

### Recap for June 26th


Music Box
  :  Student M made all his music covers clickable. We simplified his idea so that every character disappears. This means we can use the same code for every character. When clicked, they each disappear and a large background for that song will appear. 

{% include zakviewer.html Name="" ID="https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/543633250/" caption="The first four appear to be working." %}

Pong and Jumping
  ; Student N added a second level to his pong game, where the color of the apple changes. He plans to make the second level more difficult. 

He also created a jumping project. By using touching color, he makes the sprite fall into the white hole. 


```
when @greenFlag clicked
forever // if it is not touching the ground, fall
    if <not <touching color [#663b00]?>> then
        wait (.01) seconds
        change y by (-10)
    end // when low enough , return home
    if <(y position) = [-227]> then
        go to x: (-175) y: (-104)
    end // if too far right, return home
    if <(x position) > [243]> then
        go to x: (-175) y: (-104)
        broadcast [message1 v]
    end
end
```

Various Projects 
Student Y started various projects today:

...a video motion detection project

Car Project
  : Student H explored making various projects scratch and scratchjr, including a sports car. He explored recording various sound effects to make the car sound (not audible below). The project is still unfinished.

{% include giphy.html link="https://media.giphy.com/media/m9UB6b6p6X7nT5A6rz/" %} 


Goalie
  : Today Student R worked on making his goalie be able to defend the goal. He understood that he had to make the character move from side to side, but needed some help realizing that the character starts from the middle, so the first motion is just halfway. This was more difficult because of what appears to be a bug in Scratch. The following code should work without the first wait, but it doesn't.

  This project is coming along. Next we will have to do some cleaning up, such as what to do when teh ball goes out of bounds, and how to register the score. It also needs better instructions for the user.

```
when backdrop switches to [Soccer v]
wait (1) seconds // this seems unnecessary, but
goto x: (-50) y: (-6) // without it this doesn't happen
repeat (100000)
    wait (1) seconds
    glide (1) secs to x: (100) y: (-6)
    wait (1) seconds
    glide (1) secs to x: (-100) y: (-6)
end
```
{: .msb}


{% include zakviewer.html Name="" ID="https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/548760698" caption="We also worked on adding a goal line to register the score. Use the w key to move the ghost and to shoot." %}





Space Invaders
Scratch Jr. Students Y and R worked on a simplified version of Space invaders. This is really an exercise in using messages to have one character control another. The kids seem to understand the concept, but have difficulty knowing exactly where to put the elements. Nonetheless they are good at adding their own creative elements, such as this interesting missile, and are excited about making the project:

Jukebox
  : Student M made great strides on his Jukebox Project. He learned how to make all the characters disappear when you touch one character and then how to make them reappear when you touch the stage.

{% include zakviewer.html Name="" ID="https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/543633250" caption="Click on one of the first two Actors to see them change. Click on the stage to have the actors reappear" %}
 

Talking and Cat and Apple

He also started a Chase Game tutorial, which he called Cake and Apple. He started to add a new level when the score reaches 30

{% include zakviewer.html Name="Cake and Apple" ID="https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/546211814" caption="The next level will have another apple and other changes to make it more difficult." %}

Soccer Game
  : Student R and I talked about how to make the second level of his game, the soccer game. To make the ghost play, we needed blocks for left and right movement. We fixed sum code because of a Japanese ー instead of a hyphen -. We had to repurpose the w key ofr this screen to shoot the ball, not move up, so we added a a test for which layer you were on and changing he function accordingly.

### Recap for June 12th

### Ghost Baloon
Student R's project had a bug. His character changed the background. However, the Party background kept reappearing. The problem was that his code didn't reset the score after switching to the party:
  
```
when @greenFlag clicked
forever
    if <(スコア) > [100]> then
        switch backdrop to [Party v]
    end
    set [スコア v] to [0] // He needed to add this block
end
```
{: .msb}  

After figuring that out he added the second stage of his project, including adding a goalie. We added  blocks that moved to the second stage right away, to make it easier to debug. We added initializations so the goalie would appear in the right place. He made the goalie move from side to side.

{% include zakviewer.html Name="Ghost Balloon Stage 2" ID="https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/530891031/" caption="Use the w key to move the ghost up" %}


### Moving Ball 
Student N first did a tutorial involving clicking a moving ball.

{% include zakviewer.html Name="Moving Ball" ID="https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/540979288/" caption="" %}

### Walking and Talking
Soon after though he switched to a tutorial using voices. We added a simple animation to show the characters speaking. 

```
when @greenFlag clicked
go to x: (10) y: (-37)
show
repeat (4)
    switch costume to [costume2 v]
    wait (.1) seconds
    switch costume to [costume1 v]
    wait (.1) seconds
end

```
{: .msb}

Since the characters started walking, we then make the characters walk using messages.

```
when I receive [go walk v]
repeat until <touching [edge v]?>
    move (10) steps
    wait (.1) seconds
end
hide

```
{: .msb}


We talked about initializing the characters. We made the characters hide at the edge, and then return from the other edge. 
 
```

when I receive [come back from walk v]
go to x: (-240) y: (-37)
show
glide (1) secs to x: (0) y: (-37)
wait (4) seconds
```
{: .msb}

{% include zakviewer.html Name="" ID="https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/540981217" caption="" %}




### Jukebox
Student N. made a music jukebox project. He wanted each song to play until the end and then play the next songs, so we used `play sound [] until done`{: .msb} blocks. 

{% include zakviewer.html Name="" ID="https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/543633250/" caption="" %}

He also started a project using Pokemon cards and we worked on resizing the cards.


### Black Ninja
Student Y gathered a collection of Black Ninjas from the internet and worked in the editor to break them into individual sprites. Then he taught the ninja to change costume and move.


```
when [right arrow v] key pressed
switch costume to [haruki-right v]
move (10) steps

when @greenFlag clicked
switch costume to [haruki v]

when [left arrow v] key pressed
move (-10) steps
```
{: .msb}

{% include zakviewer.html Name="" ID="https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/543623161" caption="Use left and right arrow keys to move" %}


### Pong
Student H worked on a pong tutorial. He added several balls to make the game more interesting, and we made the scoring work.

### Recap for June 5th

Today there were just two students. 

Ghost Balloon Crossing
  : Student R Continued making his ghost balloon crossing game. He made each ball produce a different effect when it touched the ghost. 

* purple rotate once
* pink: push
* green: enlarge
* yellow: rotate many times
* blue: send to beginning

He also added a score variable and made the background switch to a new level when the score reached 50.

There were some coding errors in his version that we will fix next week. Here is a corrected version:

{% include zakviewer.html Name="Ghost Balloon Crossing Game (fixed)" ID="https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/541030216/" caption="Use the s, w, and t keys to move the ghost." %}


Dragon and Castle
  : Student H worked on porting his ScratchJr. **Dragon and Castle** project to Scratch. He was able to make the rocket move up if the right character was pressed, and to make the rocket turn left smoothly. His homework is to continue the path of the rocket.


```
when I receive [fire rocket v]
point in direction (0) 
repeat (10) // moves 100 steps up
    move (10) steps
end
repeat (10) /// turn left 90 degrees
    turn @turnLeft (9) degrees::motion
end

when @greenFlag clicked
point in direction (0) //rocket has been adjusted to point up in direction 0
switch costume to [rocketship-a2 v] // adjusted costume
go to x: (166) y: (4)
```

Today was a Makeup class for 2 students.

Flying Raptor?

{% include zakviewer.html Name="Name" ID="https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/538665153" caption="Eventualy the space ships will move." %}


Hacking Scratch Loops
  : Student Y was playing around with the character editor by mangling the basic Flying Cat character. 

{% include imgur.html title="original version" ID="https://i.imgur.com/IWrER1z.png" caption="" width="200px" height="" %}{% include imgur.html title="changed version" ID="https://i.imgur.com/37NeFgv.png" caption="" width="200px" height="" spacer=" "  %}

I showed him how to turn this into a basic animation, and he had a lot of fun hacking an animation"bug" in Scratch. 

```
when gf clicked
forever
next costume
wait (.1) seconds // ballerina
```
{: .msb}

The ballerina animation is changing every tenth of a second. Usually, Scratch prevents you from putting anything but a number into wait blocks.  However, the student changed the '.1' to '.e', probably by accident. You can see what happened in the cat. 

{% include zakviewer.html Name="Crazy Cat" ID="https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/538616373" caption="Watch them go!!" %}


As it turns out, Scratch does allow scientific notation, as in '.1e1' to mean .1 X 10^1, or 1. Therefore, aside from the numbers, the letter e is allowed as input. Furthermore, by design or as a bug, it even allows some nonsense values like just plain 'e' or '.E' or 'eeee', which is why the cat works. The taco and the man are flashing at '.1E1' and '.01e2' seconds each, i.e. at 1 second intervals.

```
// for other characters 
wait (.e) seconds // cat
wait (.1E1) seconds // man
wait (.01e2) seconds //taco
```

### Recap for May 22nd

Castle and Dragons
  : Student H came up with a project based on the castle and dragons app. He was able to get some sprites and we discussed how to make it so when you press the opening screen the rocket shoots up. This involves message blocks:

```
when this sprite clicked
broadcast [message1 v]  
```
{: .msb}

```
when I receive [message1 v]
point in direction (0)
repeat (100)
    move (1) steps
end
```
{: .msb}

We also had a problem that the rocket he had was in the wrong direction,s o it has to be rotated so it would be looking up when we go up. This is what it will look like.


{% include zakviewer.html Name="Rocket ship" ID="534434931" caption="Click the Cat Sprite" %}

Kimetsu No Yaiba Race 
  : Student M worked on a project where there is a race between sprites. First we created a repeat loop that moves the character from the start to the finish. Then we put this in a forever loop to keep the race going. Next week we will create a finish line that will stop the race.


```
when @greenFlag clicked
forever
    go to x: (-189) y: (-89)
    repeat (45)
        move (10) steps
    end
end
```
{: .msb} 



{% include zakviewer.html Name="Kimetsu no Yaiba Race" ID="531077045" caption="Shinobu and Kyoujuro are racing. Who will win??" %}


Cat Flying
  : Student N worked on making this cat flying tutorial. First he created a loop to make the building go from one side to the next. Then we added speed variable and we controlled the variable using keyboard inputs. 

```
when @greenFlag clicked
set [speed v] to [-10]
forever
    show
    set x to (250)
    repeat (50)
        change x by (speed)
    end
    hide
end

when [s v] key pressed
set [speed v] to [-20]

when [a v] key pressed
set [speed v] to [-5]

```
{: .msb}

### Overview for May 15th
All of our kids (in both our classes) were either ready or nearly ready to move to the next level. Yesterday, some kids were doing makeup classes so almost everyone was in the same room. This meant that yesterday was the perfect opportunity to do a group introduction to Scratch (the daddy-app of ScratchJr.) for everyone at the same time. Using Scratch will greatly improve their potential, and eliminate the limitations of ScratchJr. I am very glad we have reached this milestone. 

The first thing most students learn when starting Scratch is how to make a sprite move when you press a key. The first project most kids do is the Animate My Name Project. Some kids worked on other things.





### Importing Characters
Student M worked on importing characters for his project.

{% include turbowarp.html Name="Imported images" ID="527529590" caption="Using a google search we imported images into a project." %}



### The Backpack
Student N learned how to use the Scratch "backpack" to copy his favorite sprite from one of his other projects into this project. 

{% include turbowarp.html Name="Copying Bear" ID="530905586" caption="Click the right arrow to move the broom" %}

### Ghost game
More advanced Student R worked on a "Chicken Crossing " type game. 

{% include turbowarp.html Name="Ghost Crossing" ID="530891031" caption="Use the w key to move the ghost." %}

This project uses the w and s keys to move the ghost.

```
when [w v] key pressed
change y by (10)

when [s v] key pressed
change y by (−10)

```
{: .msb}


We talked about what should happen when the ghost hits one of the balls. We wanted the character to spin.

```
when I receive [turn ghost v]
turn @turnRight (100000) degrees::motion
```
{: .msb}

This didn't work. Why? The "rotation style" is important, or the character can't spin. We have to explicitly set it to "all around". The game also includes music. This is initialized here.

```
when @greenFlag clicked
set rotation style [all around v]
point in direction (0)
play sound [Jim Yosef & Anna Yvette - Linked [NCS Release] (320 kbps) v] until done
```
{: .msb}

This makes the ghost return to the bottom when he touches the line.
```
when @greenFlag clicked
forever
    if <touching [Line v]?> then
        go to x: (-9) y: (-130)
    end
end
```
{: .msb} 

For the balls, we worked together on making the balls return when they reached the edge. This is also where the balls tell the ghost to spin if he is touched.

```
when @greenFlag clicked
point in direction (-90)
forever
    if <touching [edge v]?> then
        go to x: (215) y: (-119)
    else
        if <touching [Ghost v]?> then
            broadcast [turn ghost v]
        end
    end
    move (5) steps
end
```
{: .msb}



### Moving a Sprite and Using the Fill
Student Y made a simple project to move a sprite.


```
when [right arrow v] key pressed
move (10) steps
```
{: .msb}


{% include turbowarp.html Name="Mover" ID="530904302" caption="Use the arrow keys to move the sprite" %}

### Using the Fill
One difference between Scratch and ScratchJr. is that the fill tool works differently. Student Y encountered the problem that, in ScratchJr., you can fill in partial shapes, but in Scratch you can only fill in closed curves. You can see this in the triangular shape at the bottom of this project.


{% include turbowarp.html Name="Ongoing Project" ID="530889948" caption="The bent line at the bottom has to be filled in by hand. YOu can see this in progress in the solid purple triangle." %}

### Recap for May 8th
Intro to Scratch
  : Today was an introduction to Scratch day for students M and N. There was some setup involved, such as installing Chrome, adding the "Scratch Addons" extension to help them use scratch. I have assigned each student a login ID and password, that they should use for all their classwork. Using an assigned account allows me to better manage and track their progress. Once they were successfully logged in, we went to we started a blank project we walked through the first tutorial. 

  : Students M and N then learned how to use the move block, play sounds. We worked through adding sounds from the music library and from files on your hard drive. Likewise for costumes, we learned how to add costumes from the costume library and the kids started working on drawing their favorite characters.

{% include turbowarp.html Name="Abu" ID="527538040" caption="Student N's favorite character uses a simple say and move blocks" %}

![Imgur](https://i.imgur.com/IgPJ73F.png){: .jsgif .autoimage}
  : * Student M played with the image editor to make a cat in a basket!

Cat and Panther Game
  : Student R, a more advanced scratch student continued worked on a chase game involving a cat chasing a panther protecting a crystal from a cat and getting points. He had some questions about how to play sounds and how to change the background. He was able to make it keep score.
  
```
when gf clicked
forever 
if <touching (1 v) ?> then 
change [スコア v] by (1)
end
if <(スコア) > (49)> then 
switch backdrop to (1 v) ::looks
hide
play sound (1 v) until done
end
end

```
{: .msb}


We worked together on code that would allow it the game to stop once it reached a certain score. We will need to talk about how to reset the game when it starts/finishes. We made a list of the things would be that would happen when the target score was reach, and we used a conditional if block with a test operator block to code the motion.

{% include turbowarp.html Name="Cat and Panther" ID="527942138" caption="Use the arrow keys to make the panther touch the cat and get points. Once you get more than 50 pts, the game ends. If the cat touches the crystal, the points are reset!" %}


ScratchJr.
  : The scratch junior kids worked on making mazes. Student Y continued working on his maze from last week. Student R made a new maze based on the linear maze turning a linear maize into a traditional pathway maze. Student H worked on various projects on his own.

![Imgur](https://i.imgur.com/iVFIeZR.png){: .jsgif}
  : * This is a linear maze

![Imgur](https://i.imgur.com/tJykOLL.png){: .jsgif}
  : * Here we surround the linear maze with blue walls

![Imgur](https://i.imgur.com/0lc87hg.png){: .jsgif}
  : * Next we remove the original maze, leaving just the walls

![Imgur](https://i.imgur.com/3k8pIib.jpg){: .jsgif}
  : * Here is a more complicated example. The black is the solution path, and the blue are false paths. The red is the walls. 
  

![Imgur](https://i.imgur.com/319Pib8.jpg){: .jsgif}
  : * If we remove the black and blue lines, we get the final maze.

### Recap for April 24th

Students H and M continued making variations of the *Usseewa* projects. This included adding dancing characters that if you touch will do extra actions. We also began exploring other music to include in their project. 

Student H plans to a Brontosaurus versus Tyrannosaurus game next.

Student N 
  : For homework, Student N made a storyboard involving several projects representing levels. Some of these were mario type jumping games with coins and so on. Others had original ideas, like having a character can disappear and then appear alternately. This required some fancy messaging. This student has been moving along quickly and is now ready for Scratch.

![Imgur](https://i.imgur.com/IHBcLlP.gif){: .jsgif}

Makeup Class
  : There was also interest in a Mario Clone devised by one of our teachers. During a makeup up class on Monday, I walked through this project with student Y (slowly, via Zoom). This is a work in progress and will continue next class. Here is the prototype:

Kids were able to make a simple version of the project. Making the moving striped rectangles involves some tricks with the drawing gui. We also recorded a special scream from the Usseewa for the character to 

Kids also continued working on their Useewa Projects, including recording the final part of usseewa and making projects with the new sounds.

One student recorded a segment of "_This is Me_" from the movie **The Greatest Showman** for a new project.

One student suggested for next week's project we tell a story using a comic 4-frame format and started working on that project.

Usseewa Day! (In case you have been living under a rock in Japan for the past few months, Usseewa is an extremely popular "pop" song by the singer Ado.) The kids in this class are obsessed with it (for this week), so today's project was to use the song in a project. The first step was to record the song using ScratchJr. and this led to a great exercise in cooperation, planning, timing, attention to detail, and other skills related to coding.

For example, this was the work flow we developed:

1. Cue up the song at the start time.
2. Run through the song to determine timing of the next endpoint. ScratchJr. can only record 30 seconds at at time, so we have to choose an endpoint near the 30 second mark. 
3. Choose the endpoint.
4. Get everyone in position to record.
5. Call for silence.
6. The countdown was 3, 2, 1, press record, wait 1 beat, start music.
7. When the music reached the endpoint, students have to press the stop record button the right time. I also tried to stop the song at that time.

We had to go through this steps several times as sometimes the recording didn't work, but we were able to get through 5 iterations.

We also used the internet to take pictures from the song video to use as characters in the project. The kids then started working on their project.

All in all the kids were very focused and motivated this week. I think they need to work a little more on developing the projects next week.

### Recap for April 3rd 

As was true last week, kids were into continuing to develop their previously learned skills, and sharing projects with each other to copy. One child made an attempt at the project of the day.

This week's project was a classic **Chicken Crossing** game. Players the chicken to get past the cars. It includes several levels of successive difficulty.

One child started to make an attempt at this project, but in the end the kids became quite busy project sharing and discussing their other recent projects. They then started recording themselves talking, and eventually recorded the currently popular song *Usseewa* into a project. Their homework is to turn this into a project. 

(Note: we don't usually allow internet use unless it is directly related to a project. You might want to remind your child of that.)

Looping Stars
  : One child submitted an interesting experiment as homework. Clicking the black button sends the yellow star back and forth. However, each new level introduces more copies (2, 4, 6, 8) of the back and forth loop, which speeds up the movement. This kind of controlled speeding up is not possible otherwise in ScratchJr.
