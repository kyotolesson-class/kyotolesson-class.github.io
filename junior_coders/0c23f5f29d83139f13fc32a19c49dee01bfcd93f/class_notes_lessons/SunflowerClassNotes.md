### Recap for March 6th

Today we worked on the Sword on the Beach Project. Tanjiro has lost his sword on the beach and we have to find it. This project is great for lots of reasons: it practices sending message, welcome screens, program logic, wait buttons, bump and touch blocks, and visibility and invisibility. The kids were very focused and were all able to finish the project. Kids then went on to work on their own variations. Several found interesting and clever places to hide the sword. Others made variations like a raining dots game using the same concepts, or a chasing game using the same buttons.

![beach game ](https://i.imgur.com/DJACDrB.gif){: .jsgif}
  : * **Beach Game** this is the original beach game I gave them. It has 2 levels, an easy one and a hard one. Kids completed the easy level, but not all tried the second level.

![raining dots](https://i.imgur.com/yf20kxc.gif){: .jsgif}
  : * **Raining Dots** The rain disappears when it touches the teddy bear.

![Teddy Bear Meadow Game](https://i.imgur.com/HZL4it6.gif){: .jsgif}
  : * **Teddy Bear Meadow Game** Abu the teddy bear is cute, and knows where to find the sword.


![Teddy Bear Chase](https://i.imgur.com/Vev6wR3.gif){: .jsgif}
  : * **Teddy Bear Chase game** Abu tries to catch the cat before time is up.


![Green Cape Beach Game*](https://i.imgur.com/HZL4it6.gif){: .jsgif}
  : * **Green Cape Beach Game** Hand-drawn arrows and clever character placement make this game fun.

Next week
  : I also introduced next week's game, the Kimetsu Sword Game. This game has several levels, and should be lots of fun.

### Homework due March 6th

Think of more Kimestu no Yaiba Questions!!!

### Recap for February 27th


Kimetsu no Yaiba Quiz Festival!
  : Today we worked on making a Kimetsu no Yaiba Quiz Game. This provides practice in sending messages, creating buttons, **Bump** and **Touch** blocks, and creating closing screens, and logic. 
  
The basic game works by having a question posed, and the player navigates to the answer they choose. If the answer is right, they get one message, if the answer is wrong they get a different one.

This is a demo project:

Here are some of the projects kids created. Everyone worked hard and was able to finish the project!!

### Homework due February 27th

Finish or make a new story project.

### Recap for February 20th


ScratchJr.
  :Today in ScratchJr. we talked about the story of the 3 little pigs, which everyone seemed to know and enjoy telling me. Then I showed the kids this the the 3 little pigs project, which was derived from a student project done last year.

![Imgur](https://i.imgur.com/MpHYbr7.gif){: .jsgif}

This involves all the skills we have been working on so far, especially sending messages and all the movement and control blocks.

Project of the day
  : The project of the day was to tell a story, either a well-known one, or one you make up. Naturally some kids were interested in make Kimetsu no Yaiba stories, but they also made other stories, for example, this story is about a bear. He uses a time machine to go back in time 24 hours, but his time machine leaves him, so in the end he has to way a day for it to come back. The clever bit is that the story then repeats itself forever!

Face Project:
  : One kid also finished up his face project, which came out pretty well.

### Homework due February 20th

Make a project like the one we did in class, using 4 buttons to control a face. 

![2 13 21 homework example](https://i.imgur.com/j8rRHzm.gif){: .jsgif}

### Recap for February 13th

Today the kids started off by coding for themselves. We worked on using the camera to take pictures. The kids had game cards, and they were putting the game cards on the screen to try to figure out how big the frame for the pictures. To get the dimensions right I taught them how to use the grid to figure out where to draw the frame. From there they could take the picture to fit in the 

![photo of card](https://i.imgur.com/AK5yyj1.jpg){: .jsgif}

One student made an interesting "rotating moon" face that soon everyone was in on copying. You can see it here:

![hiro face project first](https://i.imgur.com/URU9VjG.gif){: .jsgif}

Based on this, I came up with a project where we use various buttons to control a face in many ways. 

The top button stops the motion. The starfish returns the characters to the start position. The bottom 2 buttons move the face in different ways.

The kids started working on that project, and will finish it for homework.

Another project created today was based on the project from last week:

### Recap for February 6th

Airdrop
  : After working through some technical issues we were able to set up airdrop on kids' computers so they could share their projects with the teacher more easily.  

Race to the Finish
  : Today's ScratchJr. project was a variation of the race to the finish project. This served as a gentle introduction to using messages and making buttons. 

{% include youtubelazy.html  videoID="0QY_rF8h6-Y" %}


In this project:

1. On the first screen we touch the characters to make them move 
2. If the character touches the finish line, they say something.
3. The finish line is not visible because it is the same color as the background.
  
We reviewed the 2 keys to making messages:

1. Messages have 2 parts: a sender and a receiver
2. The color of the message must be the same for both.


Student Gallery
  : The gallery below shows some projects kids did inspired by this project:

### Recap for January 30th

Sharing Time
  : At the beginning of class I try to have a sharing time when kids can share their projects, especially their homework. All the kids worked on their homework and when they were ready we shared the results. I challenged kids to say one thing they liked about the project, and give one suggestions. This was only mildly successful as kids really wanted to work on their projects.

Project of the day
  : Today's goal was to work with the bump block. I introduced the project of the day called Animate Your Name. Kids make characters from their name or a word, and then make the characters jump in various ways when the program starts. The second part was to make the characters do even more actions when they are touched. Kids were very creative and as usual, Kimetsu no Aiba was a running theme. Kids continued to work on projects they had been working on.

Message Block
  : I also introduced the message block. This will take a while to sink in, but I tried to introduce the Knock Knock Joke project, but it seemed that kids couldn't quite get how they work. Next week I will show them this project and bring in some more jokes to see if they can learn to make conversations. 

Making a Kimetsu no Aiba Character
  : I had each kids teach me how to make a Kimetsu no Aiba character. Then we used these characters to make a conversation using the characters. 

{% include giphy.html link="https://media.giphy.com/media/k0Ds5GKIQZLRHwHtPE/" %} 

Hangman and JellyFish
  : At one point the class was a bit unruly, so to bring us all together by doing the Jellyfish song. It was a lot of fun. At the end, we played Hangman as usual. Kids really enjoyed this.

### Homework due January 30th

Make a new project, this time with a chase, as given below. 


### Recap for January 23rd

This week we made square mazes, and used the bump block.

![Imgur](https://i.imgur.com/4qQd1v2.png){: .jsgif style="width: auto;"}

to collect "tokens", just like in a MarioKart type game.

The kids made their own version. As usual they had a lot of fun designing new characters.


{% include giphy.html link="https://media.giphy.com/media/j5DU2Njy0z4VC4KHBw/" %} 

The homework is to make another square maze, but instead of collecting tokens, this time the characters play tag. As each character is bumped, they move on to the next character. Here is a sample.

### Homework due January 23rd


The homework is to continue working on their project and bring one to share next week.

### Recap for January 16th

Exploring
  : Kids were into exploring the blocks we discussed last time on their own today. They all had different ideas, though I noticed they also copied ideas from each other, which is great. 鬼滅の刃 was popular...

{% include giphy.html link="https://media.giphy.com/media/POT6Z4yMTdENSB4hxN/" %} 

Independent discovery
  : Kids were able to discover some things on their own, such as how to use repeat blocks, even though I hadn't taught these yet. Once kids got a hold of an idea, it was interesting to what they did with it, in ways i would never have anticipated.

Sharing
  : Kids really enjoyed sharing projects they were making with the class. By connecting their tablets to the big TV, they could show off their work, practice a little English, and I could help them work out their next direction.   
  
Some topics I helped kids with included:
  : * Making characters move together at the same time. 
  : * Making one character act after another
  : * Making characters bigger or smaller
  : * Erasing a character. 
  : * Using a Bump block for when one character touches another

Sending emails
  : I made a first attempt to show kids how to send their project as an email. This is useful for sharing homework and helping me plan lessons. Full directions can be found [at this link](https://www.scratchjr.org/learn/tips/share-projects). 
  
Keep working
  : When kids finished one project, I gave them another to work on. Some kids were able to complete 2 or three projects.

### Homework due January 16th

Play and explore the program as much as you can on your own but bring back a project to share with the group. 

### Recap for January 9th

Today was the first class. We walked through the Scratch Jr. Once we were at the main interface:

![scratchjrinterface](/images/jc_a_001_scratchjrinterface.jpg)

We covered: 

- The top row of buttons.
- The yellow start/green flag button
- The blue motion buttons


I gave the kids some challenges:

- Make the cat go to all four corners?
- How many times does the cat go around if he takes 99 steps?
- How many steps does he need to take to go once around side-to-side?
- How many steps does he need to take to go once around up and down?
- How many turn steps does it take to go around 1 time? 


Then we talked about drawing backgrounds and how to use the drawing program. We covered all the different buttons, and then kids spent some time playing with it. As usual, using the camera was a big favorite. 

Then they were asked to make a simple two-line maze ([see the Overview](../../Overview/JuniorCodersOverview.html) for a sample). When they were done, we shared the results. Fortuitously, one kid discovered a maze that could go on forever.
