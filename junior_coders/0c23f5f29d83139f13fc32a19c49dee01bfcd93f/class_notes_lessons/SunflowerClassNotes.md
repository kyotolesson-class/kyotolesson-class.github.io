Student M added a game over screen to his project following my example. 

{% include zakviewer.html Name="2022-09-24 Earth (revised student version) " ID="https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/736285807/" caption="He added a heart and start to the end screen, and added template code to make it play the gif at the end." %}


Student T added more to a venus fly trap project.  I showed him how to draw triangles and rotate them to make arrows pointing in different directions. He also played around using the fill tool in different shapes. I gave him a stylus to use which he found useful instead of his finger.

### Recap for September 17th

Today was the deadline for finishing the Showcase Posters. The Showcase is intended as a way to recognize and celebrate the hard work the kids have been putting in over the past few months, and especially recently. 

今日はショーケースポスターの仕上げの締め切りでした。ショーケースは、子供たちが過去数ヶ月、特に最近に費やしてきた努力を認識し、祝う方法として意図されています。

The Posters are a way to help make that tangible, but it can't convey the full extent of the kids' work. The Posters are also a way for kids reflect on and understand their coding, but incidentally also gave us a change to support their English writing. For some kids this was mostly a matter of helping them with spelling, but some kids needed more extensive support with grammar, vocabulary and sentence structure. This was a bit new for them, and it took a while for some to get used to it. We tried to set individual goals appropriate to their level and motivation, and help kids that needed it to overcome a lack of confidence and ease with writing. We modified the expectations to match individual aptitudes, so, for example, some did more drawing, and others did more writing.

ポスターはそれを目に見えるものにするのに役立つ方法ですが、子供たちの仕事の全範囲を伝えることはできません。ポスターは、子供たちがコーディングを熟考し、理解する方法でもありますが、偶然にも、英語のライティングをサポートするための変更も与えてくれました。一部の子供たちにとって、これは主にスペルで彼らを助けることの問題でしたが、何人かの子供たちは文法、語彙、そして文の構造でより広範なサポートを必要としました。これは彼らにとって少し新しいことであり、慣れるまでにしばらく時間がかかりました。私たちは、彼らのレベルとモチベーションに適した個々の目標を設定し、それを必要とする子供たちが自信の欠如と書くことの容易さを克服するのを助けようとしました。個人の適性に合わせて期待値を修正したので、例えば、もっと絵を描いた人もいれば、もっと書く人もいました。

In their own way, each child made progress. By combining art, language, and other "modalities", this activity remained accessible at all levels and aptitudes. Some students showed great creativity and expressiveness in their results, and I am sure this was a valuable of making coding a more vivid and sensory experience for them. Others have less of an artistic inclination, but I think this was still a valuable exercise for them.

それぞれの子供がそれぞれの方法で進歩を遂げました。芸術、言語、その他の「モダリティ」を組み合わせることで、この活動はあらゆるレベルと適性でアクセス可能なままでした。何人かの学生は彼らの結果に素晴らしい創造性と表現力を示しました、そして、私はこれが彼らにとってコーディングをより鮮やかで感覚的な経験にするために貴重だったと確信しています。他の人は芸術的な傾向があまりありませんが、これはまだ彼らにとって貴重な練習だったと思います。

The final results will be available for view at our Showcase, which for our class is October 1st. Parents are invited to come sny time during the 2nd hour of class, **after 4:30PM**. We look forward to seeing you.

最終結果は、私たちのクラスが10月1日であるショーケースで見ることができます。両親は、クラスの2時間目にsny時間に来るように招待されています、皆様のご来場をお待ちしております。

### Recap for September 10th

Student Y worked on final modification to his loop de loop project. He added the new loop costumes to the platform list, and began adjust the other costumes to fit in. 


```
add [ 1 ] to [costume list for all level v] // a straight platform 
add [ 21 ] to [costume list for all level v] // your new loop  
add [ 1 ] to [costume list for all level v]  //another straight platform

We also added this code:
if <(costume [name v]) = [My loop start]> then
    set [brightness v] effect to (-20)::looks
    go to [back v] layer
end

```
{: .msb}


Student N's final game modification was to make the game replay at game over. 

First he used a single green flag broadcast a master message:

```
when @greenFlag clicked
broadcast [Master v]
show
```
{: .msb} 


Then in each game he converted
```
when @greenFlag clicked
...
```
{: .msb} 


to
```
when I receive [Master v]
...
```
{: .msb} 


Then, the key point today was to understand where the code should go in the receive game over stack. We stop the other scripts, and change the backdrop to the Game over screen, wait for the mouse down, and restart the game. We also had to 

```
when I receive [GAME OVER v]
stop [other scripts in sprite v]
next backdrop
wait until <mouse down?>
broadcast [start v]


```
{: .msb} 


Student M created a game intro. He also did some careful fine tuning with the editor of the the earth costumes to remove gaps and make the border go to the edge.

Game intro and fixing position of costume and copying to add border

* ScratchJr.
: The ScratchJr. students finished working on the their Plant projects. They also started making their Showcase posters.

Student C focused on using taps, next screen and timer blocks to make a project comparing how one plant grows in the shade with 2 others that grow in sunlight.

Student T made a similar plant project, but discovered that he could loop the screens so the game continues indefinitely. He also used tap blocks to control the change between screens.

### Recap for September 3rd

Today Students Y and N worked on drawing loops for the Sonic Scroller project. The goal was to teach them the template so they can change it for their project.

I walked them through [the directions](https://digitalgardenforjrcoders.netlify.app/prep-notes/showcase/making-a-loop-de-loop-project/) for these costumes:

![Base for Loop De Loop](https://i.imgur.com/XOCMGUC.png){: style="width:45%!important" .jsgif }![](https://i.imgur.com/199xT9m.png){: style="width:45%!important" .jsgif }![Loop Start](https://i.imgur.com/IGxRDRU.png){: style="width:45%!important" .jsgif }

Then I gave them the challenge to make these by themselves: 
![Antiloop Return](https://i.imgur.com/zP2NbbN.png){: style="width:45%!important" .jsgif }![](https://i.imgur.com/2y0ilLK.png){: style="width:45%!important" .jsgif }

This will prepare them for next week. They will create many platforms and other objects for their project. They will use the code to arrange the loops and platforms to make the various levels of their project, as well as adding other game elements.

Student M continued carefully following the directions in his template and by break time he had finished the first stage of his game. 

In the last part of class student created project summaries for the Coding Showcase on September 24th.

We welcomed two new students to our class. Student C and T worked on a ScratchJr. project based on the theme of the day: Plants. Student T worked mostly in the editor creating interesting plants, while student C began animating the project with various blocks. They also played a couple of fun rounds of hangman and were given instructions for their part of the Coding Showcase.

### Recap for August 27th

Today we began with an overview of the upcoming Fall Showcase. (more information about this will be sent to parents soon.) I went over the various elements they will be prepared to talk about, such as giving an introduction, explaining the game operations, and so on.


Students Y and N worked throught a Scrolling Platformer tutorial that I had prepared. They were given the option to do an easier project, but they are very commited to doing this project.

Student N continues to work on his earth project, also working from a template. He has also become increasingly diligent recently, and made a serious effort here. 

{% include zakviewer.html Name="2022-08-27 Earth" ID="https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/725616067/" caption="He did a lot of coding this week and is almost done with the first draft of the button 1 code. Excellent work." %}

### Recap for August 13th

### Student M
Following code I suggested to him, Student M worked hard on creating his Earth Project. Though he may not understand all of the code, having him put the code in himself familiarizes him with the blocks and GUI, and his understanding is growing.



* He added broadcast and waits for:
  * initialize 
  * get initialize values
  * show initial game screen
  * start game


```
when @greenFlag clicked
broadcast [initialize v] and wait
broadcast [get initial values v] and wait
broadcast [show initial game screen v] and wait
broadcast [start game v] and wait
```
{: .msb} 

* He created a new draw routine. This replaces the old one because using if mouse down is better than if not mouse down. We also made it draw only on left part of screen

```
when I receive [start game v]
set pen size to (10)
forever
    if <(CURRENT BUTTON) = [1]> then
        if <<mouse down?> and <(mouse x) < [120]>> then
            go to [mouse-pointer v]
            pen down
            repeat until <not <<mouse down?> and <(mouse x) < [120]>>>
                go to [mouse-pointer v]
            end
            pen up
        end
    end
end
```
{: .msb} 




* Lastly, we initialized the variables that will store how much drawing has been done in each quadrant of the screen. 

```
when I receive [initialize v]
hide variable [CURRENT BUTTON v]
set [CURRENT BUTTON v] to [0]
set [DRAWN v] to [0]
set [QUAD1 v] to [0]
set [QUAD1 FULL v] to [0]
set [QUAD2 v] to [0]
set [QUAD2 FULL v] to [0]
set [QUAD3 v] to [0]
set [QUAD3 FULL v] to [0]
set [QUAD4 v] to [0]
set [QUAD4 FULL v] to [0]
set [RESULT v] to [0]
```
{: .msb}

### Student Y

{% include zakviewer.html Name="2022-08-13 Untitled-239" ID="https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/719819087/" caption="
Student Y was stuck because his bullets wouldn't stop when he stoppped pressing the space bar. We fixed it by adding a wait until not space key pressed, and it worked like a charm. He spend the rest of class looking for and creating characters to add for his project.

```
when [space v] key pressed
create clone of [myself v]
wait until <not <key [space v] pressed?>>
broadcast [delete clone v]

when I receive [delete clone v]
delete this clone

## July 9th

### Recap for  July 9th


Today students worked on their individual projects.

Templates
  : After designing their projects last week, this week I gave them text templates to follow. These templates consist of instructions for coding their project, such as: 

```
when I receive [start v]
wait (1) seconds
repeat (10)
    change size by (-9)
end
```

which they read and convert into code:

```
when I receive [start v]
wait (1) seconds
repeat (10)
    change size by (-9)
end
```
{: .msb}

After some trial and error the kids this week demonstrated that they are beginning to understand this process and are becoming familiar with the various blocks and their locations, even if they don't fully understand how to use them. As the project is further developed though they will begin to understand what the actual function of each block is. 

Demos
  : The projects are still being finished, but below are samples of the end goal. Student N and A are making essentially the same game, Flappy Bird type games. Their templates are almost identical. Today they coded the up and down movement of their main character, but there are some mistakes we need to fix. Student M is making a "Cannonball" project.

* Student N
{% include zakviewer.html Name="2022 07 09 Student N Flappy Abu" ID="https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/712796107/" caption="In Student N's case the main character is falling as objects come to him from the right." %}

### Recap for June 18th

The students came in very excited today discussing a new idea for an adventure project. It took on many forms.

{% include zakviewer.html Name="2022 6 18 Student N Super Animals Demo on Scratch" ID="https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/706788481/" caption="Studnet N's version is called 'Super Animals Demo'. One area he needed helped with was making the play button flash. After adding waits he spend some time adjusting it to look just right. " %}

{% include zakviewer.html Name="2022-06-18 Student Y" ID="https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/639424698/" caption="StudentY's challenge was making his superhero fly. He added when arrow clicked blocks, but then he found that the costume changed in size in each direction. This was because his sprites were different sizes. I showed him how to resize a sprite: we set up a hit box exactly the size of the superhero's body, and then we used onion-skinning and the alt key to resize each costume so it fit inside the hitbox." %}

{% include zakviewer.html Name="2022-06-17 Student M " ID="https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/706614887/" caption="Student M worked on making the background change when the play key was pressed using the switch backdrop block." %}

{% include zakviewer.html Name="2022-06-19 Untitled-51 on Scratch" ID="https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/706630382/" caption="He also worked on what I believe will be his title screen." %}


Student S finished her Mother-Daughter story. She became very good at using the wait block to make events happen at the right time, and also at using the grid to control how far characters move and also and setting up the block sequence so that actions take place in the right order.

### Recap for May 28th

Today students continued their projects from last week. Again I provided a template for the kids to follow. One goal was for them to be able to translate the description of the block into the actual block, for example:

* creating the variables (of the right type, for all sprites or this sprite only) when these don't exist
* using operators to create complex conditionals like `< < (variable) > (0) > or < (variable) < (0) > >`{: .msb} for if, repeat, and wait until blocks
* creating and calling custom blocks

Using a template allows me to give them a basic familiarity with the form and implemetation of different blocks even as they have yet to fully understand their function.

#### An example

```
when I start as a clone
code: [custom: choose, show order and time]::custom
 choose, show order and time::custom
code: [glide 2 secs to 0 50]::custom
glide (2) secs to x: (0) y: (50)
code: [custom: start clock]::custom
 start clock::custom
code: [wait until < < {CLOCK} < 0> or <{order filled} > 0 > >]::custom
wait until <<(CLOCK) < [0]> or <(order filled) > [0]>>
code:  [custom:  either time's up or order flled go home]::custom
  either time's up or order flled go home::custom
code:  [set {ORDER FINISHED} to 1]::custom
set [ORDER FINISHED v] to [1]
code:  [delete this clone]::custom
delete this clone
```

### Recap for May 21st

Today kids did a great job and made lots of progress, especially in perseverance when faced with challenges or failed attempts. The goal at this point is more to give them basic familiarity with a range of blocks and concepts and finding and setting up blocks, even if they are not fully grasping every concept. They are mostly still following my lead.  That said, they have been moving more quickly lately and are gaining comfort and ease with the scratch user interface. 

Today I showed the students how to resize their costumes. One concept for them to grasp was that dragging a corner/side changes the size keeping the opposite corner/side fixed. Using the alt key keeps the center fixed. I also gave them a first taste of creating and working with lists, and about the difference between for this sprite only and for all sprites for variables and lists.

In ScratchJr. this is only partly possible, because it only detects it the first time through the loop. In Scratch this can be programmed quite efficiently. He is asking the right kinds of questions to move on to the next level. After that he made Bowser float above a bridge, reusing code from another previous project.

### Recap for March 12th
Today I shared with the kids a collaborative project idea made by  the monday group. I showed them the original collaboration steps, and the final product. Then we quickly make our own collaborative project idea. 

At the end of class, I showed them a quick mockup of how the project would look.

{% include zakviewer.html Name="2022-03-12 Collaborative Project" ID="https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/658675972/" caption="" %}


Student Y changed his mind a few times about what project he wanted to make, giving up on the project he storyboard from last week. On the 3rt try he found something he really liked, Blade themed fighter project, and we walked through the storyboard process together. We put labels on the characters, and described the action and I helped him write them as steps in the storyboard. The result is a very detailed description of an interesting project. 


Student N ghost project had changed a bit since he storyboarded it, and while his computer was updating we walked through making a new storyboard, emphasizing adding descriptions to each frame for the action. 

Student M continued working on his storyboarded Ghost Bassters project, mostly gathering characters for it. Also, inspired by the class collaborative project, he made this interesting project.

{% include zakviewer.html Name="2022-03-15 CRAZY" ID="https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/550356223/" caption="" %}

Student H continued pushing the envelope while working on his excellent Mario/Bowser project. His coding challenge was that he came across a rare situation where a bump block only triggers once. This is because technically you should put a red stop block at the end of stacks, but in most cases scratchJr. runs fine without it. In fact, this is the first time I have ever seen it affect a project.

{% include niceimage-galleryNoTableweserveGifsNoLink.html folder="/images/2022-03-05-ScratchJr/" %}

He began working on the project. I showed him how to change the dimensions of the pistons so they could up and down without showing at the top.Then we used messages to make mario go back when hit by the first piston, but die when hit by the second piston. We tried to hide Mario when he fell, but realized that this would trigger a bump block. ALl in all a great job problem solving and learning about the limitations of SratchJr.

### Recap for February 12th

Scratch
  : Today I assigned students a new assignment. The goal of the project is for student to demonstrate their creativity, skill, and recent progress in learning Scratch. Projects will be collected and showcased in the class notes. The Guidelines for this project (below) are aimed at developing concentration and focus, coding skills, as well as creativity and originality.

  : After reviewing the guidelines, the students began choosing and designing their projects.

Scratch Jr. Minecraft Travel
  : Student H2 worked on a Minecraft inspired Travel Game. This game is an intro to the Pull-up technique used in platformer, where one character is falling, but hits a platform that pushes it back up using message blocks. He also learned the hidden sprite technique for detecting the bumps and causing reactions, such as Win Screens appearing. I also taught him how to take pictures using the camera tool so he could make his favorite Octonauts character the hero. He created a story for when the character dies which is his homework to code.

In the first half, Students Y and M were eager to emulate the popular Monster Hunter game in Scratch. This is quite a challenge and they began by looking for characters they could use. Though they made start of it, I think they realized it would be a very difficult challenge but they seemed committed to doing a project together. At the end of class we talked about it together and we will try ot make an easy Minecraft project next time.
