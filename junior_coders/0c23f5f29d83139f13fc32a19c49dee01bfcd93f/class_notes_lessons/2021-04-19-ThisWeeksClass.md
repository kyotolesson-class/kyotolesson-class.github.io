### Recap for April 19th

Virus Shooter
Worked on a game with student H. We planned out the game, which involves a character shooting spray paint at bad guys. I asked what the overall goal of the game was, and he said there was no real goal but to go around shooting people. However, after a while he came up with an idea involving exterminating a virus. We got to the point where we designed the main character, a villain, and a paintgun. He wanted to do some modifications on a stock character so we learned to use the image editor to flip elements, and group and ungroup elements.

This is a mockup of what part of the project might look like once we are finished:

I prompted another child to come up with a story for his project, and to try ot develop more variety in his games. He came up with a new game idea involving a wizard, some goblins trying to capture a village, and boss goblins. The goal is to capture a treasure, and he asked to review how to make music play when the treasure is touched. I again suggested adding more options and actions in the game, such as other characters or other possible actions for the wizard. This is something we will continue to work on.
