### Homework due November 27th

Keep working on your flying project.

### Recap for November 20th

Today we worked on our first Tynker Project together. A lot of time was learning to navigate Tynker, such as finding the dashboard, opening projects, and so on.

We learned how to share projects with each other and sending messages to each other. I used this to send a student some blocks to use in her projects. In addition to being fun, this is a handy way for me to be able to help students with their projects in real time.


You can sees what the project will be on the first screen of this video:

<iframe width="660" height="408" src="//www.tynker.com/ide/embedded?p=5fb857b532cb6a2dcb3be2f7&controls=false&autostart=false" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>
{: .jsgif}

We use this block set to move the character around:

![](https://i.imgur.com/c9PFvn9.png)
{: .jsgif}

The move by block do the motion, the animate and wait blocks animate the character. The wait for blocks are required. They also make sure the movement finishes before the next one is done.

Next week we might use functions and ask blocks to make the project more interesting. See screen 2 to see how it could work.

### Homework due November 20th

Play in Tynker and get used to the interface. 

### Recap for November 13th
Today we worked on a final ScratchJr. project. We made a basic video game, that involved the idea of a hero, and obstacle, and a collision. These concepts will help us in Tynker.

The project was very simple: 

* A moving obstacle and code for its movement. At first the character just moved in one direction, but then we added crazy movements. This is the fun part of the project. 
* A main character the player controls
* Buttons to control the main character. As above we made the movements a bit crazy and unpredictable.
* Code to say what happens when character and obstacle collide, like playing a sound. What kind of game it is depends on this. Maybe the goal is to hit the obstacle, or maybe it is to avoid the obstacle.

The kids went through it like pros! 

Then we moved onto Tynker as a class. My main goal was to give an overview of the interface (the UX). The key point was to get everyone to find the classroom page so they could see the tutorials and class assignments. We also covered how to:

* Open a project
* Give a project a name
* Change a character's appearance
* Share a project in the stream. 

This was a quick overview, but this will become second nature soon enough.

### Homework due November 13th

The homework is continue what you can. If you are starting Tynker, I suggest doing the "Programming 100" and "Barbie" activities that you can see by choosing "Friday and Monday Tynker Class" on your dashboard. [This link may go there directly](https://www.tynker.com/dashboard/student/#/my-classes/). 

### Recap for November 6th

This week we finished the outstanding ScratchJr Projects. I have been impressed with how diligent and patient the kids have been. 

By the end of the class all the students were ready to or had started on Tynker. Kids are mostly able to do the exercises but need some help reading and understanding the instructions at first. Also, there were some technical difficulties with Tynker related to scrolling on certain ipads, though some don't have the problem. This is a problem on Tynker's end that I need to troubleshoot. 

For this reason, next week, instead of working individually, we will work as a group on doing the tutorials. 

Tynker has pros and cons. The pros are that:

* The quality of the graphics is much better.
* It has capabilities that scratch and scratch junior doesn't have, such are ready-made tools for Mario type and other games. 
* This means students can make more satisfying and realistic games and projects.
* It still has all the capabilities tha scratch/scratchjr have
* I can follow student progress more easily, including giving help in real | times: 1

Some of the cons:

* A bit of a learning curve. It is a new interface, and is less visual than scratchjr.
* Not as well documented. The positive view is that this encourages experimentation.
* Some bugs, quirks, and compatibility issues. In the long run these should be minor problems (I hope).

Since this is a transition, there will be some bumps, but I am confident about the end goal of the journey. Hang in there!!

### Homework due November 6th

The homework this week is have fun! Play with ScratchJr. or Tynker and see if you can discover new things. 

### October 30th Recap

Only two kids today. At first they continued working on ScratchJr. As per last week, we ran up against some of the limitations of scratch, and got a chance to work on problem solving strategies. 

For example, sometimes we end up with parallel actions both having send message blocks. This can make the action jerky because the message is sent twice.

![](https://i.imgur.com/O8xdpS4.jpg){: height="200px" style="width:auto!important" .jsgif }

We discovered using only one message block on the longest one let the program run smoothly.

![](https://i.imgur.com/GXR3d6t.jpg){: height="200px" style="width:auto!important" .jsgif }

Also, what can we do when the text in a text bubble has too many characters? We worked through how to figure out how many characters the bubble can hold and how to split it up into separate messages. 

Sometimes students get frustrated when things don't work as quickly or the way they expect. The limitation could be in the software or in the hardware, like a touch screen or mouse not working the way we would like. But having problem solving strategies can give students some control over the situation and help build patience and reduce frustration. 

I offered Tynker as an option for the kids, which doesn't have some of ScratchJr.'s limitations. One student took me up on it and made great progress on the tutorials. I always encourage students to go at their own pace and follow their own interests. The other student decided she wasn't ready yet. I could see she felt comfortable with the decision, and I think when she is ready she will try it.

### Homework due October 30th

Continue working on projects. Keep up the good work.

### October 23rd Class Summary 

Everyone was hard at work on finishing projects in ScratchJr. this week. 

#### What to do when you run out of messages?

One limitation in ScratchJr. is that there are only 6 message colors available per scene. Sometimes however, you want more, which is what happened in one project. The trick to solving it is to create a **duplicate scene** that picks up where the old one left off. 

1. create a new scene 
2. copy the background of the previous scene 
3. copy the characters from the last position of the old scene 
4. move them to their last position using the grid 
5. switch to the new scene after the last action in the old scene


#### Other Scratch Limitations 

  1. The canvas is too small

Drawing in the character/background editor is difficult in ScratchJr. One trick that helps is using a two finger gesture to expand and contract the canvas so you can draw in details. 

  2. Copying shapes

Another limitation a student faced today was that the editor can copy shapes, but sometimes the copy ends up too close to the original and they get merged. There is no workaround for this other than redrawing the shape to copy it.


  2. Too many characters

It also turns out that scratchJr. gets very slow when a scene goes on for too long. Another good reason to use the duplicate scene trick.

### Tynker Pattern Maker Tutorial

Another student worked in Tynker, which doesn't have these limitations. She asked for a little help with the Pattern Maker Tutorial that involved drawing shapes like stars and squares.

![Pattern maker](https://www.tynker.com/image/support/course-puzzle-answer-keys/p100/Trailblazer%201%20Puzzle%203%20Solution.jpg)

* Repeat blocks

One requirement of the tutorial is to use repeat blocks. I showed her how to write out all the actions she plans to do to find out which actions have to be repeated and how many times. 

* Geometry and Angles

Using the grid the student has to figure out how far to walk along each edge. She also had to learn how angles work so that the character can turn the right amount. For a square the character turns 90 degrees, but for other shapes the angles is not so easy to guess, so a bit of trial and error was involved. This is good practice. Also, since the available angles were limited, she had to combine several turns to get to the right angle. 

### Plan before you code 

Students tend to want to jump right in on coding once they have an idea, but if an idea is complicated enough they need a little help planning out what is going to happen before trying to code it. This is counterintuitive, so students often need a reminder to take this step. Planning her activity before she coded it also helped her overcome a bit of "coders block" when she was starting out.

### Lots of spelling questions 

In addition to coding, there were a lot of spelling questions this week. The kids seemed to be enjoying learning English as well as coding.

### Homework due October 23rd

The homework is to continue to work on unfinished projects, especially The Halloween ("Use all the blocks") Project. Remember, the Halloween project must use each ScratchJr. blocks at least once. 

### October 13th Class Summary

As per last week, students continued working through the Family Conversation and Halloween Projects. 

Students starting a new project spent time designing each screen and the characters and actions in it on paper first, before coding. This usually saves a lot of time and makes coding smoother. It also helps them understand how their project will be experienced by the user. 

Kids like to be able to record sounds as part of their videos. But a common problem with this is that it is hard to tell who is speaking, so another theme in today's class was getting kids to think about this. Common solutions kids are using are:

* Have a text balloon open at the same time 
* Have the character move as they speak 
* Have an object move in a way that shows teh action, for example having actors pass a ball

We also did some problem solving to overcome some of scratchJr.'s limitations. With a little imagination we were able to make a character seem like they had turned around by editing their character's hair appropriately. 

### Emailing Projects

Thank you for emailing me projects. Please be sure your ScratchJr. app is up to date, as there was a bug in a recent version that prevented files from being opened.

### Homework due October 16th

The homework is to continue to work on unfinished projects, especially The Halloween ("Use all the blocks") Project. 

### October 9th Class Summary

Today, students were mostly at different stages of our progress, working towards completing the Halloween Project. 

One child was reworking her Family Conversation Project, which helped her reinforce the idea of sending messages and parallel actions. In this case that meant planning out simultaneous text to the recorded sounds as the characters spoke. 

Another student worked first on pre-planning her Halloween project and once we reviewed her outline,  she began programming it.

Another student was well along on the Halloween project, but continued to add more to the story.

Meanwhile, another student has moved on to Scratch, and completed the Pong tutorial. 

### Emailing Projects

As I mentioned in person, it would be helpful to me if students could email me projects they complete or are working on so I can review them and get a better sense of their progress and the support they need. I did a brief review with students of how to do this in ScratchJr, though the final step (complete the email) requires adult help. Full details of how to do this are available here: <https://www.scratchjr.org/learn/tips/share-projects>. The email to use is [teacher@kyotolesson.com](mailto:teacher@kyotolesson.com).

## October 2nd

### Homework due October 9th

The homework is to continue to work on unfinished projects, specifically The Family Conversation and Halloween ("Use all the blocks") Projects. 

### October 2nd Class Summary

Students continued to work on unfinished projects. 

One student has a small bug in her Family Conversation. Her characters were not speaking in the correct order. This gave her a good experience at debugging and carefully working through the code and message logic (with help) to find the source of the problem. 

Another student worked on adding simultaneous text to the recorded sounds the character spoke.

Students also learned that since ScratchJr limits each character to 5 recorded sounds, it is better to record continuous recordings as one. This is a kind of "refactoring" that comes up often in programming as the limits of a given framework are reached. 

### Upcoming Plans: Tynker

All the students in this class are familiar with all the ScratchJr blocks. Once they finished with these or a few more projects, I think we will actually be ready to move onto Scratch. In fact, I am considering moving to an improved version of Scratch I recently discovered called "Tynker". Tynker is almost identical to Scratch, but also has some improvements. It has additional blocks that are easier to understand. It has better images and drawing. 

It also allows me to observe and collaborate with students as they work in real time. As a result, it is easier to give students individual support, especially for kids who are at different levels. It is easier to create tutorials and exercises. 

Tynker is web-based and does not require installation of software. In addition, it is similar enough to Scratch that learning one effectively allows you to use the other. 

One advanced student did a trial run of Tynker with me this class and gave a favorable review. 

One issue is that students need at least a keyboard, and perhaps a mouse to use it fully. I mentioned this to parents, but please let me know if you any questions about requirements for your situation. Tynker is free to use, though it also offers (and sells somewhat aggressively) paid upgrades, which I don't plan to use in this class. They are not necessary at this point and have the potential at this point to be distracting rather than enlightening. Tynker, like Scratch and ScratchJr, does have some bugs and quirks, but so far none has been critical.

You do not need to sign up, as I have created accounts for the students already, and will provide login information at the right time.

### Homework Due October 2nd

The homework is to make a Halloween project using every single block. 

### Daily Routines and Halloween Project

Today we had only one student. The student made a wonderful series of projects devoted to daily routines, such as playing soccer and going to school. The projects showed great mastery of how to:

* send and receive messages*
* create new characters and objects using the picture editor and how to 
* weave these together to tell a story.

</details>


<details>
<summary>## Sept. 18th

## Sept. 18th


We started coding this screen in class. 
* For example, in my version:
  1. the mother (father) enters the bedroom 
  2. She tell the daughters to get up (using messages). 
  3. They each reply in turn.


If students finish screen 1, they can continue to the next few screens (see [Next Week: Finish Family Wake Up Story Project](#next-week-finish-family-wake-up-story-project) below)

### Finishing Knock Knock Joke Project

We finished the Knock Knock Joke Project. Some kids still are getting the hang of sending and receiving messages, but in the end they were all able to make the project work. 

As an added challenge for those that finished early, I had them copy the same code, but in parallel

![](https://i.imgur.com/KfBCiVd.jpg)

This clever trick allows many actions to be performed together at the same time instead of one after the other.

### Next Week: Finish Family Wake Up Story Project

To reinforce the idea of sending messages, our next project was the Family Wake Up Story.

Screen 1 (in the homework above) introduces the family.

Screen 2. The daughters loved to sing.

* This could be done in many ways.
* For example, the daughters could take turns singing.
* Or they could sing together. 
* Or Sing and Dance.

Screen 3. One day there was a storm. Their house got broken.

Screen 4 is for you to end the story the way you would like.

### September 18 Homework 

The homework for next week is to continue the Knock Knock Joke Project, by adding the joke below. The Receiving block has to match the color of the Sending block before it. Making these colors **match** is the main point of the exercise.


A: [**Green Flag**{: style="color: darkgreen;background-color: yellow"}] Knock Knock [**Send ORANGE**{: style="color: orange;background-color: yellow"}]
<br>B: [**Receive ORANGE**{: style="color: orange;background-color: yellow"}] Who's there? [**Send BLUE**{: style="color: blue;background-color: yellow"}]

A: [**Receive BLUE**{: style="color: blue;background-color: yellow"}] Ice Cream soda [**Send GREEN**{: style="color: green;background-color: yellow"}]
<br>B: [**Receive GREEN**{: style="color: green;background-color: yellow"}] Ice Cream soda who? [**Send PURPLE**{: style="color: purple;background-color: yellow"}]

A: [**Receive PURPLE**{: style="color: purple;background-color: yellow"}] Ice Cream so the other people can hear me. 
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;= *(I scream so the other people can hear me.)*


### Class Summary

The class went well. Below is a summary of what we covered.


### Sending Messages by Making a Conversation

The main topic today was how to send a message and receive a message to start a conversation.

-   First, Fairy says something and then [**Sends**{: style="color: orange;background-color: yellow"}] (an orange) message

![Fairy Sends Message](images/2020-04-20/sendMessageFromFairy.jpg "Fairy Sends Message")

-   The Frog [**Receives**{: style="color: orange;background-color: yellow"}] it (**SAME COLOR**) and responds

![Frog Receives Message](images/2020-04-20/FrogReceivesMessageAndResponds.jpg "Frog Receives Message")

Key Point:
: The **color**  of the [**Receive**{: style="color: orange;background-color: yellow"}] on the Frog matches the color of the [**Send**{: style="color: orange;background-color: yellow"}] before it on the Fairy.

### Continue the conversation

We also talked about how to make a longer conversation:

1. As before, the Fairy starts (speaks and sends ORANGE message. You need to connect it!)
   ![Um Froggie](images/2020-04-20/umFroggie.jpg "Um Froggie")
1. Froggie replies
   ![alt-text](images/2020-04-20/yesFairy.jpg "Hover text")
1. Then Sends a New RED Message (remember to connect it!)
   ![alt-text](images/2020-04-20/sendRedMessage.jpg "Hover text")
1. Fairy receives the **red** message. Says something. Then she continues by sending a YELLOW message back to Froggie (connect it).
   ![alt-text](images/2020-04-20/thisIsNotAForest.jpg "Hover text")
1. What color message does Froggie Receive?

### The KEYS to Messages

-   Each message has 2 parts, sending and receiving.
-   They have to be the SAME color! (did I mention that?)
-   One character sends. The other receives, and acts.
-   They can send a new message back....

#### Knock Knock Joke Project

We made a Knock knock Joke project. The joke is below. Notice the color of the [**Send and Receive Blocks**{: style="color: darkgreen;background-color: yellow"}]. 

A: [**Green Flag**{: style="color: darkgreen;background-color: yellow"}] Knock Knock [**Send ORANGE**{: style="color: orange;background-color: yellow"}]
<br>B: [**Receive ORANGE**{: style="color: orange;background-color: yellow"}] Who's there? [**Send BLUE**{: style="color: blue;background-color: yellow"}]

A: [**Receive BLUE**{: style="color: blue;background-color: yellow"}] Wooden Shoe [**Send GREEN**{: style="color: green;background-color: yellow"}]
<br>B: [**Receive GREEN**{: style="color: green;background-color: yellow"}] Wooden Shoe who? [**Send PURPLE**{: style="color: purple;background-color: yellow"}]

A: [**Receive PURPLE**{: style="color: purple;background-color: yellow"}] Wooden Shoe like me to tell you another joke? 
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;= *(Wouldn't you like me to tell you another joke?.)*

### Sept. 4th Homework

The homework for this class is to continue working on the Dragon Maze with Buttons (see below). The homework is to make 4 buttons, one for each direction. Then add the cake and dragon, like last week.


### Review first maze

As a class, we revised last week's homework project.
* We moved the cake and added a dragon.
* If we touch cake the the dragon disappears. 



Here is an  example with pictures. This example has some things we didn't do in class. You can ignore them. We will go over it in class next week.

1.  Cake sends a message using a yellow "bump" block. (In the example, cake also receives the **same** green message, and says goodbye to the dragon)

![Cake sends a message to the dragon](../class_notes_lessons/images/2020-04-13/Screen%20Shot%202020-04-14%20at%2011.58.43%20AM.png){:height="59px"}

2. Dragon gets the message and disappears. (In the picture, the dragon waits, gets bigger, says something, gets smaller, says something, and then, **finally disappears**..)

![Dragon gets the message](../class_notes_lessons/images/2020-04-13/Screen%20Shot%202020-04-14%20at%2011.58.51%20AM.png){:height="59px"}


3. A receive block on the cat makes the cat step off the cake (no picture, sorry)

### Improved Dragon Maze with Buttons

We next improved the above project using buttons to control the cat. 

#### Making the Maze in the Background

First we made the maze in the background. The maze is a bunch of "squares" with "openings" cut out. 

See the images below, but the steps we did in class are:


1. Draw the maze. Make the maze "square"

{% include giphy.html link="https://media.giphy.com/media/h5pP1wMLfQugZxf7Ny/" %} 

1. Color the background. This is just for fun.

{% include giphy.html link="https://media.giphy.com/media/dXdU0SxHG5BYonm3aA/" %} 

1. Draw buttons. 

{% include giphy.html link="https://media.giphy.com/media/ZAwboqCd8zB5iUW6ok/" %} 

1. The buttons send messages to the cat to make it move. 


{% include giphy.html link="https://media.giphy.com/media/cho8wnCflgTUChuDSF/" %} 


### Sept 11 Preview

Messages are very important in ScratchJr.. Next week we will use "messages" to make conversations between characters.

### Add a Dragon and a Cake.

Add a dragon and a cake as in the original project.

### August 28th Homework Challenge

The homework for next week is to make a maze like the one we did today, except it has two exits and two cakes. Can you stop to eat one cake and then move on to the other. This might be challenging, so don't despair. If it is difficult, just do your best. 

Next week will use that to send messages and make dragon mazes. 

### August 28th Recap

Today we worked on Simple Mazes. Skills we practiced included:

-   Drawing lines
-   Removing "dots" to make the lines straight
-   Moving dots to change the shape, direction, and position of the line
-   Using the blue blocks to make the characters move
-   Adding New Characters
-   Adding New Screens
-   Moving from one screen to the next

### Making the Maze in the Background

1. First click the select arrow and then click a line.
2. The line will appear with dots.
3. Click on a dot to remove it.
4. Remove all the dots except 2 to make a perfectly straight line.
5. Drag the dots to modify the path of the line.
6. Using a series of lines, make a maze in the background.

### Walking The Path

1. Use the blue movement blocks to make the character walk the along or within the lines.
2. When the character reaches the end they said "Victory"
3. Add a cake at the end of the path.
4. Then, using yellow "bump" blocks, when the character touches the cake, the cake disappears.
5. Add another screen.
6. Go back to original screen and using a red block make screen change when cake disappears.
7. Design a 2nd screen like the first, with a different maze.
8. Have it loop back to the first screen

### July 17th Homework

The homework for next class is:

1. Finish the Animal House Project
2. Do the Outer Space and Animal debugging exercises above.

Below is a summary of what we did in class.

### July 17th Homework Review: Outer Space

We reviewed and developed the [Outer Space project](./scratchProjects/Y1R17Outerspace.sjr). Kids watched the project run and tried to make their own similar code. One key idea was **having two or more actions happen at the same time**. For example, click the astronaut link below, and you can see the astronaut does 3 actions at the same time:

1. He turns,
2. moves up, and
3. shrinks then disappears.

This creates the effect of him spinning off into space and disappearing. This trick is very important in ScratchJr.

#### Debugging: Outer Space

Here are some problems to solve:

{% include niceimage-galleryNoTableweserveGifsNoLink.html folder="/scratchProjects/Y1R17OuterspaceDebugging/" %}

1. Why doesn’t the sun spin when pressed?
2. Why does the alien stay in the air and not hop back down?
3. Why doesn’t the shooting star hide after it shrinks?
4. Why doesn’t the astronaut fly up when pressed?

<details>
<summary>#### Debugging: Outer Space Answers
</summary>

#### Debugging: Outer Space Answers

1. It needs the start on tap trigger
2. The move up block needs to be replaced with a hop block
3. The show block needs to be replaced with a hide block
4. The number (parameter) on the move up block needs to be greater than 0

### July 17 Break

We played Hangman during the break, and it was a lot of fun. For a change, the kids worked together to choose a word ("Doctor") that I had to guess. They almost stumped me!

### Animal House

We then moved to making characters talk, either by recording sounds, or adding text bubbles. Our model was the Animal House Project from BootUp.

{% include youtubelazy.html  videoID="ie-PcCGplu4" %}

The kids worked on their own version of the project, and the homework was to finish the project.

#### Debugging: Animal House

Here are some debugging exercises.

{% include niceimage-galleryNoTableweserveGifsNoLink.html folder="/scratchProjects/Y1R18AnimalhouseDebugging/" %}

1. Why does the barn get bigger and not bigger, then smaller?

2. Why does the chicken play a pop sound and not the recorded sound?

3. Why does the horse play the same recording twice instead of two different recordings?

<details>
<summary>#### Debugging: Animal House Answers

#### Debugging: Animal House Answers

1. The second grow block should be a shrink block

2. The pop block sound be a play recorded sound block

3. The second play recorded sound block should have a number 2 and not a number 1

### Review the Under the Sea

We reviewed the homework projects. The original Under teh Sea project can be [downloaded here](./scratchProjects/Y1Q15UndertheSea.sjr).

### Initializiing a character

To set the initial position, visibility, or size of a character:

-   **manually** change the position of the character.

![Initial Position](./images/2020-07-10/20200710InitialPosition.gif)

Note in the gif above, if I use a block to change the position, it returns when I press the return button. If I manually move it, it stays.

-   **manually** change the visibility

![Initial Position](./images/2020-07-10/20200710Invisble.gif)

-   **manually** change the size

![Size](./images/2020-07-10/20200710Size.gif)

This is useful if you want a character to start off small, or in a certain position.

-   Rotation **doesn't work**

![Rotation](./images/2020-07-10/20200710Rotation.gif)

### Repeats

#### Repeat the Repeat

I briefly discussed repeats within repeats:

1. Put some actions in a repeat block.
2. Add something to that, and put that in a repeat block
3. Repeat step 2

Not so interesting at this point.

### Drawing Backgrounds and characters

We reviewed the Drawing Editor to:

-   Create circles, squares, and lines
-   Use different thicknesses
-   Fill in drawings
-   Move drawings
-   Change the shape of blocks
-   Delete drawings

### Face Spinner

{% include youtubelazy.html  videoID="4r-WH7c5w0M" %}

[Download here](./scratchProjects/Y1R16Fidgetspinner.sjr)

To practice using the editor, the kids reverse engineered the project above, but then, for fun, we put each other's pictures in the circles to make cool **Face Spinner**.

Then they made the spinner spin. As a challenge, I proposed making the spinner go fast at first and slower later. Most kids did it this way:

![Rotation](./images/2020-07-10/20200710Fidget.png){: height~"200px"}

### July 10th Hangman

At the end we had a little time left and we played Hangman. For some kids it was their first time playing this classic children's spelling game!

### July 10 Homework: "Outer Space"

{% include youtubelazy.html  videoID="EQ8FqqIM_Rc" %}

The homework is to try to make this project just from watching the video. The stars and sun are just like we did in class. The Green Cat is a little different and you might have to think about it. The Astronaut is a new trick we will learn next time!

## July 3rd

This week we continued working on learning basic ScratchJr Blocks.

### July 3rd Sharing Time

The kids shared the work they had done by themselves during the week. Kids learned a lot.

Children explored using the various motion blocks to create interesting dances. They created their own versions of projects similar to the following Bootup Projects:

1.  Dance Alone

{% include youtubelazy.html  videoID="XO9bv2Oz_68" %}

2. Can't Stop Dancing

Uses repeat block to repeat motion

{% include youtubelazy.html  videoID="ZPgbWqX4Nog" %}

3.  Dance Party: several sprites perform at the same time.

### Game: Black

We played the game called [Black](../lessons/gameBlack.html). The game teachers kids several concepts related to coding, including making choices, thinking about future steps, and logical reasoning.

### Game Teacher Says

We played the [Teacher Says](../lessons/TeacherSays.md) game. This game helps us learn each other's name, as well as teaching about sequencing event and following instructions.

### ScratchJr Intro

I did a simple introduction to the ScratchJr. interface. We covered:

-   The home button
-   The green flag/start block
-   The settings
-   The blue motion buttons
-   The purple size buttons
-   The say nd record buttons

We also talked about the image interface:

-   Changing the color of elements
-   Undoing actions

Kids then spent some time experimenting with these. Kids shared their "discoveries".

We will review all these again next class.

![scratchjrinterface](./images/jc_a_001_scratchjrinterface.jpg)

### June 28th homework

The homework is for kids to teach parents how to play [Black](../lessons/gameBlack.html).

Also kids should play with ScratchJr and try to discover new things about how it works.
