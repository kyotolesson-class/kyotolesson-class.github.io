## July 3rd

This week we continued working on learning basic ScratchJr Blocks.

### July 3rd Sharing Time
The kids shared the work they had done by themselves during the week. Kids learned a lot. 

Children explored using the various motion blocks to create interesting dances. They created their own versions of projects similar to the following Bootup Projects:

1.  Dance Alone

2. Can't Stop Dancing

Uses repeat block to repeat motion

3.  Dance Party: several sprites perform at the same time.

## June 27th

### Game: Black

We played the game called [Black](../lessons/gameBlack.html). The game teachers kids several concepts related to coding, including making choices, thinking about future steps, and logical reasoning. 


### Game Teacher Says 

We played the [Teacher Says](../lessons/TeacherSays.md) game. This game helps us learn each other's name, as well as teaching about sequencing event and following instructions.


### ScratchJr Intro

I did a simple introduction to the ScratchJr. interface. We covered:

* The home button 
* The green flag/start block 
* The settings
* The blue motion buttons
* The purple size buttons
* The say nd record buttons
 
We also talked about the image interface:

* Changing the color of elements 
* Undoing actions 

Kids then spent some time experimenting with these. Kids shared their "discoveries".

We will review all these again next class.

### June 28th homework
The homework is for kids to teach parents how to play [Black](../lessons/gameBlack.html). 


Also kids should play with ScratchJr and try to discover new things about how it works.
