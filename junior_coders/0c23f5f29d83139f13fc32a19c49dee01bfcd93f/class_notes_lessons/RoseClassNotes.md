### Sept. 4th Homework

The homework for this class is to continue working on the Dragon Maze with Buttons (see below). The homework is to make 4 buttons, one for each direction. Then add the cake and dragon, like last week.


### Review first maze

As a class, we revised last week's homework project.
* We moved the cake and added a dragon.
* If we touch cake the the dragon disappears. 



Here is an  example with pictures. This example has some things we didn't do in class. You can ignore them. We will go over it in class next week.

1.  Cake sends a message using a yellow "bump" block. (In the example, cake also receives the **same** green message, and says goodbye to the dragon)

![Cake sends a message to the dragon](../class_notes_lessons/images/2020-04-13/Screen%20Shot%202020-04-14%20at%2011.58.43%20AM.png){:height="59px"}

2. Dragon gets the message and disappears. (In the picture, the dragon waits, gets bigger, says something, gets smaller, says something, and then, **finally disappears**..)

![Dragon gets the message](../class_notes_lessons/images/2020-04-13/Screen%20Shot%202020-04-14%20at%2011.58.51%20AM.png){:height="59px"}


3. A receive block on the cat makes the cat step off the cake (no picture, sorry)

### Improved Dragon Maze with Buttons

We next improved the above project using buttons to control the cat. 

#### Making the Maze in the Background

First we made the maze in the background. The maze is a bunch of "squares" with "openings" cut out. 

See the images below, but the steps we did in class are:


1. Draw the maze. Make the maze "square"

![](./images/2020-09-04/1-drawingDragonMaze.gif){: width="100%" height="auto"  .gif}



1. Color the background. This is just for fun.

![](./images/2020-09-04/2-coloringBackground.gif){: width="100%" height="auto"  .gif}


3. Draw buttons. 


![](./images/2020-09-04/3-addButton.gif){: width="100%" height="auto"  .gif}


4. The buttons send messages to the cat to make it move. 


![](./images/2020-09-04/4-sendMessages.gif){: width="100%" height="auto"  .gif}



### Sept 11 Preview

Messages are very important in ScratchJr.. Next week we will use "messages" to make conversations between characters.

### Add a Dragon and a Cake.

Add a dragon and a cake as in the original project.

### August 28th Homework Challenge

The homework for next week is to make a maze like the one we did today, except it has two exits and two cakes. Can you stop to eat one cake and then move on to the other. This might be challenging, so don't despair. If it is difficult, just do your best. 

Next week will use that to send messages and make dragon mazes. 

### August 28th Recap

Today we worked on Simple Mazes. Skills we practiced included:

-   Drawing lines
-   Removing "dots" to make the lines straight
-   Moving dots to change the shape, direction, and position of the line
-   Using the blue blocks to make the characters move
-   Adding New Characters
-   Adding New Screens
-   Moving from one screen to the next

### Making the Maze in the Background

1. First click the select arrow and then click a line.
2. The line will appear with dots.
3. Click on a dot to remove it.
4. Remove all the dots except 2 to make a perfectly straight line.
5. Drag the dots to modify the path of the line.
6. Using a series of lines, make a maze in the background.

### Walking The Path

1. Use the blue movement blocks to make the character walk the along or within the lines.
2. When the character reaches the end they said "Victory"
3. Add a cake at the end of the path.
4. Then, using yellow "bump" blocks, when the character touches the cake, the cake disappears.
5. Add another screen.
6. Go back to original screen and using a red block make screen change when cake disappears.
7. Design a 2nd screen like the first, with a different maze.
8. Have it loop back to the first screen

### July 17th Homework

The homework for next class is:

1. Finish the Animal House Project
2. Do the Outer Space and Animal debugging exercises above.

Below is a summary of what we did in class.

### July 17th Homework Review: Outer Space

We reviewed and developed the [Outer Space project](./scratchProjects/Y1R17Outerspace.sjr). Kids watched the project run and tried to make their own similar code. One key idea was **having two or more actions happen at the same time**. For example, click the astronaut link below, and you can see the astronaut does 3 actions at the same time:

1. He turns,
2. moves up, and
3. shrinks then disappears.

This creates the effect of him spinning off into space and disappearing. This trick is very important in ScratchJr.

{% include niceimage-galleryNoTableweserveGifsNoLink.html folder="/scratchProjects/Y1R17Outerspace/" %}

#### Debugging: Outer Space

Here are some problems to solve:

{% include niceimage-galleryNoTableweserveGifsNoLink.html folder="/scratchProjects/Y1R17OuterspaceDebugging/" %}

1. Why doesn’t the sun spin when pressed?
2. Why does the alien stay in the air and not hop back down?
3. Why doesn’t the shooting star hide after it shrinks?
4. Why doesn’t the astronaut fly up when pressed?

<details>
<summary>#### Debugging: Outer Space Answers
</summary>

#### Debugging: Outer Space Answers

1. It needs the start on tap trigger
2. The move up block needs to be replaced with a hop block
3. The show block needs to be replaced with a hide block
4. The number (parameter) on the move up block needs to be greater than 0

</details>

### July 17 Break

We played Hangman during the break, and it was a lot of fun. For a change, the kids worked together to choose a word ("Doctor") that I had to guess. They almost stumped me!

### Animal House

We then moved to making characters talk, either by recording sounds, or adding text bubbles. Our model was the Animal House Project from BootUp.

{% include youtubelazy.html  videoID="ie-PcCGplu4" %}

The kids worked on their own version of the project, and the homework was to finish the project.

#### Debugging: Animal House

Here are some debugging exercises.

{% include niceimage-galleryNoTableweserveGifsNoLink.html folder="/scratchProjects/Y1R18AnimalhouseDebugging/" %}

1. Why does the barn get bigger and not bigger, then smaller?

2. Why does the chicken play a pop sound and not the recorded sound?

3. Why does the horse play the same recording twice instead of two different recordings?

<details>
<summary>#### Debugging: Animal House Answers
</summary>

#### Debugging: Animal House Answers

1. The second grow block should be a shrink block

2. The pop block sound be a play recorded sound block

3. The second play recorded sound block should have a number 2 and not a number 1

### Review the Under the Sea

We reviewed the homework projects. The original Under teh Sea project can be [downloaded here](./scratchProjects/Y1Q15UndertheSea.sjr).

### Initializiing a character

To set the initial position, visibility, or size of a character:

-   **manually** change the position of the character.

![Initial Position](./images/2020-07-10/20200710InitialPosition.gif)

Note in the gif above, if I use a block to change the position, it returns when I press the return button. If I manually move it, it stays.

-   **manually** change the visibility

![Initial Position](./images/2020-07-10/20200710Invisble.gif)

-   **manually** change the size

![Size](./images/2020-07-10/20200710Size.gif)

This is useful if you want a character to start off small, or in a certain position.

-   Rotation **doesn't work**

![Rotation](./images/2020-07-10/20200710Rotation.gif)

### Repeats

#### Repeat the Repeat

I briefly discussed repeats within repeats:

1. Put some actions in a repeat block.
2. Add something to that, and put that in a repeat block
3. Repeat step 2

Not so interesting at this point.

### Drawing Backgrounds and characters

We reviewed the Drawing Editor to:

-   Create circles, squares, and lines
-   Use different thicknesses
-   Fill in drawings
-   Move drawings
-   Change the shape of blocks
-   Delete drawings

### Face Spinner

{% include youtubelazy.html  videoID="4r-WH7c5w0M" %}

[Download here](./scratchProjects/Y1R16Fidgetspinner.sjr)

To practice using the editor, the kids reverse engineered the project above, but then, for fun, we put each other's pictures in the circles to make cool **Face Spinner**.

Then they made the spinner spin. As a challenge, I proposed making the spinner go fast at first and slower later. Most kids did it this way:

![Rotation](./images/2020-07-10/20200710Fidget.png){: height~"200px"}

### July 10th Hangman

At the end we had a little time left and we played Hangman. For some kids it was their first time playing this classic children's spelling game!

### July 10 Homework: "Outer Space"

{% include youtubelazy.html  videoID="EQ8FqqIM_Rc" %}

The homework is to try to make this project just from watching the video. The stars and sun are just like we did in class. The Green Cat is a little different and you might have to think about it. The Astronaut is a new trick we will learn next time!

## July 3rd

This week we continued working on learning basic ScratchJr Blocks.

### July 3rd Sharing Time

The kids shared the work they had done by themselves during the week. Kids learned a lot.

Children explored using the various motion blocks to create interesting dances. They created their own versions of projects similar to the following Bootup Projects:

1.  Dance Alone

{% include youtubelazy.html  videoID="XO9bv2Oz_68" %}

2. Can't Stop Dancing

Uses repeat block to repeat motion

{% include youtubelazy.html  videoID="ZPgbWqX4Nog" %}

3.  Dance Party: several sprites perform at the same time.

{% include youtubelazy.html  videoID="YsS21mU9Nxg" %}

[Download](./scratchProjects/Y1Q13DanceParty.sjr)

4. Starry Night; Putting it all together

{% include youtubelazy.html  videoID="kxQGuTWfXx0" %}

[Starry Night from Bootup](./scratchProjects/Y1Q14StarryNight.sjr)

### July 3rd Homework: Under the Sea

The homework was to create a project like the following.

### Game: Black

We played the game called [Black](../lessons/gameBlack.html). The game teachers kids several concepts related to coding, including making choices, thinking about future steps, and logical reasoning.

### Game Teacher Says

We played the [Teacher Says](../lessons/TeacherSays.md) game. This game helps us learn each other's name, as well as teaching about sequencing event and following instructions.

### ScratchJr Intro

I did a simple introduction to the ScratchJr. interface. We covered:

-   The home button
-   The green flag/start block
-   The settings
-   The blue motion buttons
-   The purple size buttons
-   The say nd record buttons

We also talked about the image interface:

-   Changing the color of elements
-   Undoing actions

Kids then spent some time experimenting with these. Kids shared their "discoveries".

We will review all these again next class.

![scratchjrinterface](./images/jc_a_001_scratchjrinterface.jpg)

### June 28th homework

The homework is for kids to teach parents how to play [Black](../lessons/gameBlack.html).

Also kids should play with ScratchJr and try to discover new things about how it works.
