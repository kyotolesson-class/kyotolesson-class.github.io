UFO
  : Student S worked on her own project for a while, and then we worked together on an original project about UFO's. Two cats are speaking. She learned the "bump and step back" trick to activate a bump without getting stuck in a loop. She used wait blocks to make a conversation, and then a UFO appears.

Student S made another BootupPD project called my family. We then upgraded the project by making the characters speak, and I gave her the challenge of making the characters speak in turn. This is an exercise in using bump blocks, the start block, and message blocks. Next we will continue making the conversation pass from person to person in the project.

Student A worked on a rocket project and played with the costume editor and adding photos.

ScratchJr
  : The ScratchJR kids worked on making a racing game based on this BootupPd project. 

{% include youtubelazy.html  videoID="0QY_rF8h6-Y" %}

First we made the characters move at different speeds, and to return home when they touch another character at the end of the line. Student A had a lot of fun experimenting with the drawing editor. Student S made this into a Mother's Day project, and showed initiative and creativity in choosing characters and in making the course go vertically, which looks very nice.

ScratchJr
  : Student A decided to review skills by making his own project. It involved characters moving across the screen and bumping into each other. He also greatly enjoyed typing in various emoji. 

  : Student S made a project where the characters move, bump into each other, and can be tapped to do things. This is a review of how to use in the bump, touch and loop blocks.

First, Student H completed a 5 minute challenge to refactor a shooter game so it worked with the arrow keys instead of the w-a-s-d keys. Then I helped him change a video into a gif to import it into a new project. To help him maintain focus I used a 5 minute timer for him. If he maintained focus for 5 minutes, he would gain some free time. This seemed to be increase the amount of time he could stay on focus.

{% include zakviewer.html Name="2022-05-06 戦え" ID="https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/684157189/" caption="He also made several new mini-projects such as this one, which shows considerable progress." %}

* Today Student M worked on his **Cat owns a Convenience Store** project. 


{% include imgur.html title="" ID="https://i.imgur.com/KZZjj53.png" caption="The first step was to set up 3 variables: room occupants, max in room, money.

* The other students in the class took turns "tutoring" Student S in using ScratchJr. They began a project with 2 screens, and I challenged her to continue the story on her own.

{% include imgur.html title="" ID="https://i.imgur.com/X6CV8nC.gif" caption=" She created a game where the cat chases the piece of toast. If it touches the toast it shrinks and the user has to touch it to make it bigger again. We talked about how to know when a game is over, and suggested the game end after 25 loops. She worked well on her own, and I gave her some help making the toast say 'ouch' using the bump block, and adding a jump to the fourth screen, by adding a blank screen, returning to screen 3, and then dragging the block. She also learned how to drag a sprite to a screen to make a copy of it in that screen." width="" height="" spacer="" %}

We talked about how to size the health that make up his health meter. We created a new message to eliminate the need for many individual sprites and go directly to the main health sprite. We struggled to position the hearts at the right location, because it turned out an error elsewhere in his code was hiding the heart." %}


Student Y worked on figuring out how his player should choose their costume. Unusually, he dseems to have decided on a mix between randomly and with some user control. Once this is clear, he will be able to code it.

Student S chose to make another square maze like this: 

![](./../../../junior_coders/Overview/images/FollowTheMazeGame.gif)

Her focus was on learning how to use the paint editor to change line shapes, how to use the camera to import Pokemon images (for the buttons) into the paint editor, and then how to create buttons using messages. 

Student D worked on making a simplified Math Quiz. The key point was how to use messages to control the sequence of actions: Question 1 => Answer 1 -> Question 2 => Answer 2 -> Question 3 => Answer 3 -> Game over screen, where each arrow is a send/receive pair of blocks. He also learned how to use the camera to import images, and about using the hide and show blocks.

Students M and H made minor progress on their recent projects.

### Recap for April 15th

Student M worked on developing his Cat Owns an Inn project. His plan is
* Each cat that goes into Room 1 gives $2
* A maximum of 5 cats can go into the room
* If you have more than $10, the maximum goes up by 1
* If the room is full, the cat goes back and has a worried expression. 

We began to code this, and talked about the variables we would need. 

Students Y and K are both at a stage where their Demon Game programs need to use clones to create multiple copies of a sprite. Today we discussed exactly how they want to use the clones. For example, how to choose weapon randomly or how to create hearts to show character strength. Once it is clear what they want, we will be able to make the clones behave as they should.

Students A and S worked first on making square mazes. In addition to giving practice in using the paint editor to control line thickness and fills, it demonstrates creating buttons that send messages.

![](./../../../junior_coders/Overview/images/FollowTheMazeGame.gif)


For a follow-up challenge we then created an Animate My Name project. The special challenge was making the middle letter make the outside letters change places. This involves one message going to two sprites at the same time.

{% include imgur.html title="" ID="https://i.imgur.com/7P6sz1j.png" caption="Student M worked on making his cats point in the right direction when they appear. This involved an if test.  We used a set rotation style to keep the cat from rotating upside down, and set the direction to 90 or -90, depending on the variable left or right. The variable left or right is 1 when the character is on the right, and 2 when the character is on the left." width="" height="" spacer="" %}



Scratch Jr New Students
  : New student S1 used ScratchJr. to make a maze. We created a sprite with a set of shapes, and then she taught the cat to move around the shapes. We coded it so that if she touched the shapes, she would return to the original position. At the end we added a target sprite and a special effect when we successfullly reach the end of the maze.

  : New Student S2 started off by exploring Scratchjr. on his own. He told me he likes Pokemon characters, and he played with the paint editor. We made the pokemon characters move around the screen. I taught him how to copy code and he discovered that copying the same motion script made the characters move faster and faster.

1. created the background for the main screen. I showed him how to use one sprite for the background, then use a switch costume block to change the background. This is better than using multiple sprites. 
2. He used when I receive block to change the background once choosing the level. 
3. He created a spider and I helped him look for Minecraft soundboards to get the sounds for the spider.<span >" %}

### Recap for February 25th

[Last week](#february-18th) we turned a bitmap image into a collection of vector pieces that can be used to make an animation. This week the kids repeated the process on their own without my help. This involved taking images, removing the background using pixlr, slicing them into parts and reassembling them into animation frames.

For student K  we also talked about how to create a transition to the main screen using broadcast/receive blocks. He will have to finish this next week.

### Recap for February 18th

This week the kids worked on making an animation using a stock Minecraft character. Thy plan to use this as part of their Demon Games Project. The kids worked very well together and helped each with ideas and learning the steps.

1. They searched google and found the image they wanted. 
2. They used the [pixlr remove background](https://pixlr.com/remove-background/) removal tool to remove the background. 
3. They imported the result into their project as a bitmap file.

     <br>


5. They copied these parts into separate costumes and converted them into vector images.
6. They reassembled the body by pasting all these parts into one full vector image, with movable parts.

7. They created a sequence of animation frames using onion-skinning.
8. Next week they will code these to create animations.

### Recap for January 21st

In the beginning of class we spent some time clarifying our goals for the Demon Games Project. We decided that each student would stick to the main outline of the game, but would independently create their own game characters, looks, and so on. This allows for them to develop the game at their own pace while still reusing some code but with ample room for individual creativity and control.

### Recap for January 14th & 15th

On Friday Student K and I worked in an online drawing program called [Sketchpad](https://sketch.io/sketchpad/) to draw the opening screen of their project, Demon Games (formerly Demon Toetation). This paint editor is superior to the one in Scratch and he learned how to use various functions such as choosing a font, copying stickers, importing photos, and changing colors and fills. We then imported this into Scratch and created the opening backdrop for the project. He also created a Start button this way.

On Saturday, Student Y built on this by coding the start button to open the level selection screen. He also used Sketchpad to create a starred backdrop, and coded the easy, medium and hard button to set the difficulty variable. We talked about how this variable would be used in the game to control the number of demons generated.

Even though the two students were working separately they are working well as a team to handle different parts of the project. It's very exciting to see this project take shape.

  : The students have decided to work together on an original game Demon Toetation Land. It is loosely based on a minecraft game, but with interesting variations of their own. They drew out a detailed storyboard including characters and character names, a "manga" version of battle mode, a complicated system for the number of enemies and the how they take damage, as well as the motion and actions of the sprites controlled by keypresses. This is a good outline and has potential to be a really fun game. With a few more additions, coding the project will be straightforward.
