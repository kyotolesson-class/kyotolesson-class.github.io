## July 10th

### Review the Under the Sea

We reviewed the homework projects. The original Under teh Sea project can be [downloaded here](./scratchProjects/Y1Q15UndertheSea.sjr).


### Initializiing a character

To set the initial position, visibility, or size of a character:

* **manually** change the position of the character. 

![Initial Position](./images/2020-07-10/20200710InitialPosition.gif)
  
Note in the gif above, if I use a block to change the position, it returns when I press the return button. If I manually move it, it stays.

* **manually** change the visibility 

![Initial Position](./images/2020-07-10/20200710Invisble.gif)

* **manually** change the size 

![Size](./images/2020-07-10/20200710Size.gif)


This is useful if you want a character to start off small, or in a certain position. 

* Rotation **doesn't work**

### Repeats 

#### Repeat the Repeat

I briefly discussed repeats within repeats:

1. Put some actions in a repeat block.
2. Add something to that, and put that in a repeat block
3. Repeat step 2

Not so interesting at this point.


### Drawing Backgrounds and characters

We reviewed the Drawing Editor to:

* Create circles, squares, and lines 
* Use different thicknesses
* Fill in drawings
* Move drawings
* Change the shape of blocks
* Delete drawings

### Face Spinner

To practice using the editor, the kids reverse engineered the project above, but then, for fun, we put each other's pictures in the circles to make cool **Face Spinner**. 

Then they made the spinner spin. As a challenge, I proposed making the spinner go fast at first and slower later. Most kids did it this way:

### July 10th Hangman

At the end we had a little time left and we played Hangman. For some kids it was their first time playing this classic children's spelling game!

### July 10 Homework: "Outer Space"

The homework is to try to make this project just from watching the video. The stars and sun are just like we did in class. The Green Cat is a little different and you might have to think about it. The Astronaut is a new trick we will learn next time!

## July 3rd

This week we continued working on learning basic ScratchJr Blocks.

### July 3rd Sharing Time
The kids shared the work they had done by themselves during the week. Kids learned a lot. 

Children explored using the various motion blocks to create interesting dances. They created their own versions of projects similar to the following Bootup Projects:

1.  Dance Alone

2. Can't Stop Dancing

Uses repeat block to repeat motion

3.  Dance Party: several sprites perform at the same time.

## June 27th

### Game: Black

We played the game called [Black](../lessons/gameBlack.html). The game teachers kids several concepts related to coding, including making choices, thinking about future steps, and logical reasoning. 


### Game Teacher Says 

We played the [Teacher Says](../lessons/TeacherSays.md) game. This game helps us learn each other's name, as well as teaching about sequencing event and following instructions.


### ScratchJr Intro

I did a simple introduction to the ScratchJr. interface. We covered:

* The home button 
* The green flag/start block 
* The settings
* The blue motion buttons
* The purple size buttons
* The say nd record buttons
 
We also talked about the image interface:

* Changing the color of elements 
* Undoing actions 

Kids then spent some time experimenting with these. Kids shared their "discoveries".

We will review all these again next class.

### June 28th homework
The homework is for kids to teach parents how to play [Black](../lessons/gameBlack.html). 


Also kids should play with ScratchJr and try to discover new things about how it works.
