Student Y started working on the next screen of his Demon Game.  

{% include imgur.html title="" ID="https://i.imgur.com/cyRp0Ck.png" caption="He created a mockup of the screen and collected the blocks that he will used for it. Most of these are derived from Minecraft." width="" height="" spacer="" %}

<br/>
Student K likewise did the same, though his approach was different. His main focus this week was using broadcast and receive blocks to change the screen.

Both kids made significant progress today.

1. created the background for the main screen. I showed him how to use one sprite for the background, then use a switch costume block to change the background. This is better than using multiple sprites. 
1. He used when I receive block to change the background once choosing the level. 
2. He created a spider and I helped him look for Minecraft soundboards to get the sounds for the spider.<span >" %}

2. Initialized the variable and updated it each click. 
3. Used an if block to test the number of clicks, and perform an action on the 5th click. <br>

### Recap for February 25th

[Last week](#february-18th) we turned a bitmap image into a collection of vector pieces that can be used to make an animation. This week the kids repeated the process on their own without my help. This involved taking images, removing the background using pixlr, slicing them into parts and reassembling them into animation frames.

For student K  we also talked about how to create a transition to the main screen using broadcast/receive blocks. He will have to finish this next week.

### Recap for February 18th

This week the kids worked on making an animation using a stock Minecraft character. Thy plan to use this as part of their Demon Games Project. The kids worked very well together and helped each with ideas and learning the steps.

1. They searched google and found the image they wanted. 
2. They used the [pixlr remove background](https://pixlr.com/remove-background/) removal tool to remove the background. 
3. They imported the result into their project as a bitmap file.

     <br>



4. They then sliced the image to separated the arms, legs, and head. 

    {% include imgur.html title="" ID="https://i.imgur.com/Tz4xbyf.png" caption="" width="" height="" spacer="" %}

     <br>


5. They copied these parts into separate costumes and converted them into vector images.
6. They reassembled the body by pasting all these parts into one full vector image, with movable parts.

     <br>
  
7. They created a sequence of animation frames using onion-skinning.
8. Next week they will code these to create animations.

Only one student today.

Demon Game

### Recap for January 21st

In the beginning of class we spent some time clarifying our goals for the Demon Games Project. We decided that each student would stick to the main outline of the game, but would independently create their own game characters, looks, and so on. This allows for them to develop the game at their own pace while still reusing some code but with ample room for individual creativity and control.

{% include zakviewer.html Name="2022-01-23 Demon Games 2022 01 21 Y" ID="https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/631710507/"  caption="Student Y began making weapons. I showed him how to make a slight modification to his code to create a highlight effect using a colored highlight sprite when clicking on a level." %}

### Recap for January 14th & 15th

On Friday Student K and I worked in an online drawing program called [Sketchpad](https://sketch.io/sketchpad/) to draw the opening screen of their project, Demon Games (formerly Demon Toetation). This paint editor is superior to the one in Scratch and he learned how to use various functions such as choosing a font, copying stickers, importing photos, and changing colors and fills. We then imported this into Scratch and created the opening backdrop for the project. He also created a Start button this way.

On Saturday, Student Y built on this by coding the start button to open the level selection screen. He also used Sketchpad to create a starred backdrop, and coded the easy, medium and hard button to set the difficulty variable. We talked about how this variable would be used in the game to control the number of demons generated.

Even though the two students were working separately they are working well as a team to handle different parts of the project. It's very exciting to see this project take shape.

  : The students have decided to work together on an original game Demon Toetation Land. It is loosely based on a minecraft game, but with interesting variations of their own. They drew out a detailed storyboard including characters and character names, a "manga" version of battle mode, a complicated system for the number of enemies and the how they take damage, as well as the motion and actions of the sprites controlled by keypresses. This is a good outline and has potential to be a really fun game. With a few more additions, coding the project will be straightforward.
