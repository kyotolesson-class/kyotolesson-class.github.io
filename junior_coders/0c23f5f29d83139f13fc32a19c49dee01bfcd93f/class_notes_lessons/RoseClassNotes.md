### Recap for April 23rd

Tynker
  : The project this week was a maze game. 

![Imgur](https://i.imgur.com/PCrNSUO.gif){: .jsgif}

Straight Lines
  : One key skill for this is knowing how to make straight lines, as described in the [Dragon Maze](../lessons/DragonMazept1.html). 
  
1. First click the select arrow and then click a line. 
2. The line will appear with dots. 
3. Click on a dot to remove it. 
4. Remove all the dots except 2 to make a perfectly straight line. 
5. Drag 2 dots directly over each other to make a sharp corner. 
6. Drag the dots around to modify the path of the line. 
7. Using a set of lines, make a maze.

![the path of a line in the background](./images/2020-04-13/linearPaths.png){: .bordered width="300px"}

Today I really emphasized step 5, to make a sharp corner. Student Y became very ambitious in his maze and it had long lines, with lots of twists and spirals. This required precision handling of all the dots, and counting the dots needed. I thought this would be discouraging, especially because he wasn't using a stylus, but just his finger. But in the end he kept at it and worked very hard to get what he wanted. Great Job! 

Student K finished his maze and moved on to making the [Dragon Maze](../lessons/DragonMazept1.html). He also worked on. 

Student R was also able to complete the maze, and had a lot of fun adding music.

Exploring Tynker
  : Student Y spent today's class exploring various tutorials and projects looking for his next project to complete. He seems to have settled on make a comic strip project.

Beach Project
  : Student A continued working on her Beach project. She realized that is was a bit hard to get to some of the candy, so she started working on making a basket that the candy could go in when you collect it. We chose a basket image from Google, and used [Pixlr](pixlr.com) to remove the background. Then we inserted it into the project.

When she hits the good candy, the bad candy disappears and the good candy goes to the basket. She goes back to the starting point." %}

Snowboarder
  : For the snowboarder project, student C continued working on a "life" system for kids. When a player collects bad candy, she loses one life. Before she was using separate actors for each life, and I suggested making each life be a costume. That way she can use the "next costume" block to keep score.  This is a simple alternative to using variables.

ScratchJr.
  : Kids continued work on last week's project, and started the new project of the week.

One kids continued working on the cat crossing project, to make it diagonal. Then I introduced this week's project, based on Flappy Bird.

![Imgur](https://i.imgur.com/ThWtzp3.gif){: .jsgif}

Then he started work on the flappy bird project. 

[keigo flappy]

Another kid made a rocket project. We worked on how to switch screen, and how to return to a screen with the rocket in the right place. He came up with the idea of making a copy of the original screen to go to. Then I taught him about the 3 types of mazes and how to make straight lines. He made a simple maze project

![Imgur](https://i.imgur.com/fCLJ9WX.gif){: .jsgif}

Another child created a simple beach project that shows an understanding of the bump and touch actor blocks.

tynker
  : Kids finished the projects they were working on, and are now choosing their next project.

One child finished his **maze and villian training** project. We worked detecting when a character is a certain distance away before giving a message.

![Imgur](https://i.imgur.com/2MajNEI.png){: .jsgif}

And he worked on giving the actors the right health and lives to make the game interesting. Here is how it ended up:

## April 9th


### Recap for April 9th

Today students were very creative in coming up with their own ideas and solutions to problems. This is an important step in avoiding getting stuck or frustrated.

Beach Project: Making Candy Disappear
  : Continuing from last week, one student came up with what do when the good candy was found. Her idea which was for two of the good candies have all the bad candies disappear. This helped her learn how to use messages and how to broadcast a message and how to hide AKA disappear a character. We also worked on making the character a bit smaller, otherwise there is no way to win the game!!



Beach Project: Moving hearts offscreen
  : Another child worked on making hearts appear. To get the hearts to disappear again after a few seconds she had to learn about screen coordinates. THe student is now working on giving the player lives.


Undocumented Tynker "bug": The bad guy that would not die
  : Another student's Tynker project had a bad guy that would not die. He would reappear even though he was programmed to have only one life. The solution turned out, in an undocumented "feature" that the properties block needs to be part of the same block that has the run and set up character block. Once we fixed this, the program worked!

ScratchJr. Chicken Crossing beginning steps
  : Some beginner students are interested in doing the chicken crossing project that some more advanced students are doing. Lat week they had made interesting houses and characters for the project. This week, we worked on teaching them how to make characters the right size and run across the screen in different ways using the movement blocks. We also  how to use an infinite loop how to use a bump block and a touch block to start the chicken moving. The kids also worked on their own exploring various blocks.

ScratchJr. Chicken Crossing advanced steps
  : A more advanced student worked very hard on an alternate version of the chicken crossing game. The goal this time was to make the roads diagonal. After the basic idea (parallel code blocks) was explained, this student was able to create this project all by himself which was quite an achievement. One problem was making the characters move across the screen because the screen is not square. We didn't quite solve this problem, but we explored alternatives.
  
Tynker: Using a loop to change the size of a character
  : another pupil working on Tynker had a question about how to make a character get larger. We used a loop to change the size of the character and a wait block to make the animation effect visible. In the end, though, she decided to just have the character get larger in one big jump.

### Recap for April 2nd 

ScratchJr.
  : We did an introductory class for some new students focusing on using the image editor. For other ScratchJr. students, this week's project was a **Chicken Crossing** game. 

Chicken Crossing
  : In this classic game, click the chicken and get past the cars. Our version includes several levels. 

{% include giphy.html link="https://media.giphy.com/media/4GOIrt8uOxBKfyp4FG/" %} 

One student was able to recreate the project pretty well just by watching it run. The chicken gets across in stages, which adds challenge. Nice project.

{% include giphy.html link="https://media.giphy.com/media/DDDMOrtKeBEyue6KVF/" %} 

The project itself is simple, using just a few blocks

![Imgur](https://i.imgur.com/mSFmW1f.png){: .jsgif}

![Imgur](https://i.imgur.com/EiEUFxA.png){: .jsgif}

but gives good practice in reusing code and also has many opportunities for variations. For example, the occasional back-step in the truck code adds a bit of challenge. 

Tynker
  : In Tynker, the **Beach Project** and variations made some headway.

Snowboarder
  : One student is working on a variation of the Beach Project where a snowboarder finds candy on the slopes. She was able to make the snowboard move, and is working on making the snowboarder react to the good and bad candy.

![Imgur](https://i.imgur.com/FAIBe6b.png){: .jsgif}

Mermaid
  : Another student is working on sending messages when her mermaid touches the candy. When she touches the bad candy, she goes back to her home place. 

![Imgur](https://i.imgur.com/CLIhAFX.png){: .jsgif}

![Imgur](https://i.imgur.com/f0NOMxL.png){: .jsgif}

She has also added code for the good candy.

ScratchJr.
  : Today I introduced the Walking Cat Project to one student. It has a walking cat, infinite motion, lots of waits to control timing, messages to control the action and make a conversation, bringing together skills students have learned recently.

![Imgur](https://i.imgur.com/uumIRpL.gif){: .jsgif}

Tynker
  : Today students worked mostly on tutorials. One student had a problem with the cake decoration game because her stamp didn't seem to work. This was likely due to a bug in Tynker on iPads, and not the student's code, which was correct. Working together on it did give her a chance to experience debugging and testing.

Tynker
  : Students worked on tutorials and continued the Beach Project
  
One student new to Tynker continued doing tutorials. She needed some help understanding loops, and pointing in directions. 
  
Another continued the Beach project. She had originally made the main character test to see if she touched the candies. It turned out that this did not work, probably due to a bug in Tynker, so we came up with a new algorithm (good practice), have the candies test to see if they are touching the main actor. 

![Imgur](https://i.imgur.com/cndgFaq.png){: .jsgif}

This worked! Though a bit of a detour, it did give the student lots of practice with getting the blocks and moving them to place, which for this student was very useful. At the end, we decided to make the actor return to the home place if she touches a bad candy, using messages.

![Imgur](https://i.imgur.com/M84P92K.png){: .jsgif}

![Imgur](https://i.imgur.com/ZvMJ9kh.png){: .jsgif}

ScratchJr.
  : The project of the day was a Mario Type game. The main actor has to jump over blocks that approach from the side of the screen. First we make a loop that moves clouds across the screen, with a wait before they reappear at the other side. We then use this to make the blocks approach the actor. 

First, the student shared a project they had done for homework, based on last week's project.

{% include giphy.html link="https://media.giphy.com/media/0hnqrS7nrT61XqF5cD/" %} 


Then I walked the student through all the steps for the project of the day, and the student made their own version.

Tynker
  : Great progress today as most students worked on variations of the Beach game.
 
One student worked on moving the main character with keypresses, and sending and receiving messages. Then she learned how to detect if characters are touching.

![Imgur](https://i.imgur.com/jq0Go4b.png){: .jsgif}

Another student created an interest "Dropping Hearts" effect when the characters was touched. This involved sending a message to both the actor touched and to the cherry effect.

![Imgur](https://i.imgur.com/4wKLNzp.png){: .jsgif}

![Imgur](https://i.imgur.com/0mYeOgd.png){: .jsgif}

We also talked about how to make the motions smoother or faster or longer.


![Imgur](https://i.imgur.com/rkUtxc2.png){: .jsgif}

Students needing review worked with the tutorials including one student who moved up from ScratchJr. to Tynker today.

Scratch Jr.
  : Today we worked on a Kimetsu No Yaiba Sword Game. Just from watching the project once, the student  was able to figure out how to recreate it. 

![Imgur](https://i.imgur.com/aVzfo9T.gif){: .jsgif}
  : * A basic Kimetsu no Yaiba Sword game. Note that the arrows move the actor, and also keep the actor on screen. When the sword hits, the actor says hit.

### Homework due March 12th

Keep working on your project, or try a new project

### Recap for March 5th


ScratchJr.
  : We continued working on the Beach Game project, and I introduced a new Sword Game.

For the beach project, one student made a project around finding a starfish. She had an opening screen, two game play screens and a final screen. She was able to complete a basic game where a rabbit uses buttons to move the rabbit towards a starfish. A bump block then has the starfish say you found me, and used messages in both the buttons and when the starfish is found. Then the rabbit finds the starfish hidden in some igloos while being watched by polar bears. 

![beach game](https://i.imgur.com/L2WWft4.gif){: .jsgif}

This was a great effort with a lot of independent work. I suggested adding instructions for the user as to how to use the game and transitions between the screens, and she worked on that.

The other student combined a story and a game. The main story is about a horse and man. The horse kicks away a rabbit and then challenges the man to a game to see who can find an apple first. At this point the game begins. The horse finds the apple first and wins a soccer ball. This was a great combination. The game came with a working set of buttons to move the horse and the man. It was a good use of say blocks, message blocks, scene change blocks, mostly done independently without much assistance. I helped with some of the logic, so that the horse announces he is the winner AFTER he gets the apple, not before.

Tynker:
  : This week kids continued and finished work on the beach game/candy hunt project. 
  
Some kids started with setting up the main hero's movement, either with **move** blocks or **change** blocks.

![Imgur](https://i.imgur.com/sLIBfBn.png){: .jsgif}

![Imgur](https://i.imgur.com/fLRNUjA.png){: .jsgif}

Some moved on to getting the program to sense when the candy is found.

### Homework due March 5th

Work on the Beach Candy Game

### Recap for February 26th

Today we focused on planning. As a group, the class came up with a project. 

<style>
ol li ul li ol {
    margin-bottom: 0px;
</style><!-- fixes bad spacing here -->
1. First we decided on the type fo project, a game. 
2. Setting: The beach
3. Story/Goal: Find and collect candy hidden in the sand.
4. Actors/Actions:
   * Protagonist(s) ("Good guys"): Sheep walks, jumps, digs, picks things up 
   * Antagonist(s) ("Bad guys"): 
      1. Insect attacks and bites 
      2. Skunk sprays 
   * Macguffins (sought-for items) 
      1. Good Candy give points: 
         * Lollipops
         * Chocolate
         * Gummy Bears
         * Cookies
         * Hi-chew
         * Hot Chocolate
      2. Bad Candy loses points, or send actor back to beginning. 
         * old shoes
         * old chocolate
         * smelly socks
         * smelly lollipop
         * coffee

The kids then started working on programming it. So far, the project is a simplified, modified version of the above.

ScratchJr.
  : The game was simplified for ScratchJr. For the protagonist, we used a little girl, for the antagonist, we used an Elephant, and for the MacGuffin we used starfish. In addition, we could only have one piece of candy on the screen.

In Scratch Jr. the kids also needed to make a way for the actor to move, so we repeated the control buttons using messages, as we had done  in the **Race To the Finish** project [a few weeks ago](http://localhost:4000/junior_coders/0c23f5f29d83139f13fc32a19c49dee01bfcd93f/class_notes_lessons/RoseClassNotes.html#february-5th).

From there, we use bump blocks on the starfish, so that when the girl touches the starfish, the start fish says something, and then we move to the next screen.

The project is underway and should be completed next week.

Tynker
  : In Tynker the focus was on choosing actors. 

Kids worked on making the characters the right size and placing them in various places.

Some kids started coding movement using **when key pressed** blocks

![Imgur](https://i.imgur.com/sLIBfBn.png){: .jsgif}

The **did I touch** function block in the repeat block means we have to test to see if the girl had found (is touching) the candy each time we move. We replace it with the following **if touching?** block:

![Imgur](https://i.imgur.com/TMK8ey7.png){: .jsgif}

This sends a message to the "candy" touched. (The break stops the motion of the girl.) The candy gets the message and reacts.

![Imgur](https://i.imgur.com/JubN3mw.png){: .jsgif}

We will work on this next week.

### Recap for February 19th

ScratchJr.
  : Today in ScratchJr. we worked on the the 3 little pigs story. This involves all the skills we have been working on so far, especially sending messages and all the movement and control blocks.

I showed the kids the sample project, which was derived from a student project done last year.

![Imgur](https://i.imgur.com/MpHYbr7.gif){: .jsgif}

After a brief explanation, one student turned this out, with barely any help from me. 

![Imgur](https://i.imgur.com/HpMWoZk.gif){: .jsgif}

Impressive job!

The second part of the project was to retell any well-known story. One child asked how to make it appear as if a character were walking, and I showed her a simple trick of moving the background instead of the character to give the appearance of movement:

![Imgur](https://i.imgur.com/pgtMPZB.gif){: .jsgif}

Tynker
  : In Tynker one student continued a whirlwind tour of sample projects. She spent some time working with the characters in the Animation Board project, but it was a bit difficult, so she settled on the Underwater Arcade.

In this project, her challenge was to make the fish move down. Unfortunately she had put the loop in the wrong place

![Imgur](https://i.imgur.com/nFhPH7E.png){: .jsgif}

but after some work she was able to debug it.

Keep working on knock knock jokes.

### Recap for February 12th

Today I taught kids about [Knock Knock Jokes](../lessons/KnockKnockJokes.html) and [Bad Jokes](../lessons/JokesForBadJokes.html) 


#### ScratchJr.

For the ScratchJr. kids, I showed them the project below, and then they worked to create it themselves. They then added their own screens with more jokes.

This is the joke I started with. Notice the color of the [**Send and Receive Blocks**{: style="color: darkgreen;background-color: yellow"}]. 

A: [**Green Flag**{: style="color: darkgreen;background-color: yellow"}] Knock Knock [**Send ORANGE**{: style="color: orange;background-color: yellow"}]
<br>B: [**Receive ORANGE**{: style="color: orange;background-color: yellow"}] Who's there? [**Send BLUE**{: style="color: blue;background-color: yellow"}]

A: [**Receive BLUE**{: style="color: blue;background-color: yellow"}] Wooden Shoe [**Send GREEN**{: style="color: green;background-color: yellow"}]
<br>B: [**Receive GREEN**{: style="color: green;background-color: yellow"}] Wooden Shoe who? [**Send PURPLE**{: style="color: purple;background-color: yellow"}]

A: [**Receive PURPLE**{: style="color: purple;background-color: yellow"}] Wooden Shoe like me to tell you another joke? 
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;= *(Wouldn't you like me to tell you another joke?.)*

Here is what the code looks like for A in ScratchJr.

And how it looks when running:

![Knock Knock Jokes ](https://i.imgur.com/rHDO8RZ.gif){: .jsgif}

#### Tynker 

For the tynker group, I did the same joke and basic project. We used different blocks though. Here is the first (Germy) actor's code:

![Imgur](https://i.imgur.com/tnZ34QJ.png){: .jsgif}

This is what the final project will look like.

#### February 5th Tynker

Tutorials
  : One student started out on tutorials but then decided to try the cake decorating project. In the project there are various kinds of icing we can put on a cake. We walked through the code step by step together for the first few types of icing. She was very focused and learned a lot. By the time we were done she was able to code new icing by herself and her homework is to finish the project.

Fruit Frog
  : One student spent her time exploring various projects tutorials. Some of them needed explanation and I sat with her to show her what was involved. One of the projects she did was "Fruit Frog" where a frog prince eats fruit with its tongue. She changed the frog to a lizard, but had to add some code to make the lizard show up and be the right size.

  : Today's ScratchJr. project was a variation of the race to the finish project. This served as a gentle introduction to using messages and making buttons. They both make a lot of progress but had a bit to finish for homework.

### Recap for January 29th

Technical problems

  : Today class was a bit hectic. Some students have been using new computers and some still have some technical problems with them, such as logging in a getting internet. We also had a trial student.

ScratchJr.
  : Today's project was an animate your name project. Kids did a great job with it. They added their own name or other word as characters and created movements with both the green flag and for touch actions.

Tutorials
  : Some students are still working on tutorials. Using loops is still challenging, so we worked together on that. 


Walking Guy
  : One student discovered how to make a basic Platformer game and explored making different characters.

Peep Nature Walk
  : A student came up with a story about going shopping Peep Nature Walk. Today she worked mostly on deciding the layouts and actors and she drew a basic background for the store and we ended at the point where we could begin adding this to her project.

### Recap for January 22nd


ScratchJr.
  : We looked at some sample projects, and students copied and modified the projects.
  : For example, an aquarium with various fish that moved in various ways. The student worked carefully to make two characters move in sync. 
  : Another student used the touch block to make the player choose between two different levels. 

Cake Decorator
  : Student worked on a cake decorator project. This ```when actor clicked :: events hat ```{: .msb}  block selects the icing to put on the cake by changing the "stamper" costume. The student wanted to be able to unselect the icing, which involved a bit of complicated code. To get a little more understanding of if statements, the student continued working on some releavant Barbie tutorials.

Christmas Project
  : Work continued on the Christmas Project. The student learned how to make say blocks a little more interesting.

Peep Nature Walk
  : Another student explored a couple of projects. Then she worked a bit on the Peep nature walk project. She changed the appearance one on of the characters, and her homework is to make a plan to continue the story.

### Recap for January 15th

New Students and ScratchJr.
  : Two students joined our class today, and we continued with the introduction to ScratchJr from their trial lesson. We reviewed their homework project, and then did a basic review of the purple, green and orange blocks. At this point I challenged them to explore freely what they could do with the blocks they knew at this point, and this is their homework for next week. In class one project was notable for making three characters move together in unison and stopping at the edge of the screen.

Knock Knock Jokes
  : After doing many tutorials in Tynker, one girl started to work on a basic project, a knock knock joke project. She decided she wanted to change the stock actor the project came with, and got very excited at all the characters, especially the mermaids, that are available in the media library. After exploring this for a while she asked if we could make the Mermaid King's flippers move as if he were swimming. This is actually hard to do in Tynker, but I walked through the simple cut, paste, and rotate actions that are part of partially creating that effect. She also made some other modifications to the Mermaid King, like changing the color of his sword.

Tutorials
  : Lastly, another student worked independently on finishing up the Barbie Pets Tutorial, and continuing on a Christmas-themed project. She had a small question about one section of the tutorial, but eventually got it. The ability to work independently is a sign of increased confidence and mastery.

### Recap for January 8th


Kids were very motivated today, and worked hard.

Tutorials
  : Barbie tutorials are a lot of fun. One child worked very hard on a barbie pet tutorial. One challenge she had was understanding repeat blocks. Instead of walking then jumping then walking then jumping then walking then jumping, we can just repeat the walk-jump three times. I used some playing cards to map out the differences, and suddenly, "click", she got it. It's a big step, because loops are, of course, a central concept in coding. 
  
  : The student then went on to create a new project and created  characters. C
  
  : Another student also working through tutorials had some issues using the trackpad on her new computer. Using the trackpad is  probably worth a lesson, and maybe I will spend some time on it next week.

Making characters bigger. 
  : Several students asked about how to make Smaller too.  
  
Birthday card
  : Lastly, one student Lucy made a birthday card for her mom that came out really well. Based on a tutorial project, she changed the background, and the costumes of various characters, including drawing her own birthday present, and recording a birthday song. We also worked together to make the present hop along the bottom of the screen. We used some of the ideas from last class about x and y position to figure out where the present would glide to to make it look like it was jumping. This included working out how many times it would jump to get across the screen, and how to jump back to the other side. Of course, I made a **classic mistake** of forgetting that the x and y position change after each step, so I have to calculate the **relative** position, but the exercise was worth it. Here is the final project:

Here is the code for the jumping birthday present.

## New Year's Day, 2021

### Homework due January 8th

Keep working on your individual projects. 

### Recap for New Year's Day, 2021

Today, instead of working on individual projects, we worked on a basic tutorial that leads to a keyboard-based game. The tutorial focuses on:

x, y, and positive and negative numbers,
  : because these a core concepts, we spent a lot of time learning about the four quadrants, and how to tell where an actor or the mouse is.

"go to" versus "glide"
  : go to magically transports the actor to the new position, "glide" moves through the intervening space.

In the games, kids collect coins by moving or gliding the actor to places in different quadrants. Once they understood the concepts above, they have to code the correct blocks. The only way to collect some blocks is by gliding, and others they need "go to" for. They also have to work out which position is in which quadrant. 

At first, these mathematical ideas are a bit challenging, but once they could see how it played in a real game they really understood it, and were able to work out the correct blocks all by themselves. A job well done!!
