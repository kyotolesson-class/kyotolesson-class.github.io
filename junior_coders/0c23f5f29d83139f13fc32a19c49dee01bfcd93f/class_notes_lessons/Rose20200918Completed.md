## Sept. 18th


### Sept. 25th Homework

The homework for next week is to continue working on the Family Wake Up Story. The story went as follows:

Screen 1. Once upon a time there was a mother. She had four daughters.

* We started coding this screen in class. 
* For example, in my version:
  1. the mother (father) enters the bedroom 
  2. She tell the daughters to get up (using messages). 
  3. They each reply in turn.


If students finish screen 1, they can continue to the next few screens (see [Next Week: Finish Family Wake Up Story Project](#next-week-finish-family-wake-up-story-project) below)

### Finishing Knock Knock Joke Project

We finished the Knock Knock Joke Project. Some kids still are getting the hang of sending and receiving messages, but in the end they were all able to make the project work. 

As an added challenge for those that finished early, I had them copy the same code, but in parallel

This clever trick allows many actions to be performed together at the same time instead of one after the other.

### Next Week: Finish Family Wake Up Story Project

To reinforce the idea of sending messages, our next project was the Family Wake Up Story.

Screen 1 (in the homework above) introduces the family.

Screen 2. The daughters loved to sing.

* This could be done in many ways.
* For example, the daughters could take turns singing.
* Or they could sing together. 
* Or Sing and Dance.

Screen 3. One day there was a storm. Their house got broken.

Screen 4 is for you to end the story the way you would like.
