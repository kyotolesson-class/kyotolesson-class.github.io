### Homework due November 6th

The homework this week is have fun! 

### October 30th Recap

Only two kids today. At first they continued working on ScratchJr. As per last week, we ran up against some of the limitations of scratch, and got a chance to work on problem solving strategies. 

For example, sometimes we end up with parallel actions both having send message blocks. This can make the action jerky because the message is sent twice.

We discovered using only one message block on the longest one let the program run smoothly.

When the text in a text bubble has too many characters. We worked through how to figure out how many characters the bubble can hold and how to split it up. 

Sometimes students get frustrated when things don't work as quickly or the way they expect. Sometimes the limitation is the software, and sometimes it is the hardware, like a touch screen or mouse not working the way we would like. But having problem solving strategies can give students some control over the situation and help build patience. 

One student also started using Tynker this week. I always encourage students to go at their own pace and follow their own interests. I offered Tynker to the other student, but she other decided she wasn't ready yet. I think it was a wise choice.
