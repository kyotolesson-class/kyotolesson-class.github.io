## Junior Coders Beginner's Challenge

One challenge we have is that students often want to make projects that are a bit above their skill set. The best way to develop your skill set is to do Scratch Tutorials. These set you on the right path by teaching particular skills that make any project easier to code and better to play. Today we initiated aa new challenge to help get motivated to do the Scratch tutorials.

Every month students will receive awards based on:

1.  The number of projects or tutorials they complete
2.  The more they complete in a given month the better the award
3.  Minimum of 3 per month. This week is a headstart for next month's inaugural.
4.  Project should include at least one feature not already in the projects or in another project the student has done
5.  Projects may not include violence or inappropriate content
6.  Awards are evaluated each month but collected at the end of completion of all the projects in other words you must do all the projects before you can collect your Awards and prizes. Small intermediary prizes might be awarded based on outstanding effort.
7.  Once you have completed all the tutorials you will collect a completion prize based on the awards you earned.
8.  Prize categories include:
    - Original, unusual, or unique ideas
    - Number of new features
    - Hard work and diligence
    - Overall Design
    - Clever use of artwork
    - Pleasant use of sound and music
    - Ease of use
    - and more
