### Review Projects

### Work on Project as a class

The story game. Each person adds one idea.

Then we make the story together in scratch. Each person gives one "step".

Possible "steps" are:

-   Add character
-   Trigger block + up to 3 actions, for example:
    -   green flag + move right and down and repeat 3 times
    -   touch trigger + disappears
    -   etc.
-   send message and receive message plus 2 actions
-   character says something
-   backgrounds:
    -   We make the background together.
    -   Take turns adding strokes or figures.
    -   Once background is done it cannot be changed without everyone's agreement

You may not change other people's actions without their agreement.
You may add to them
You may make them do unexpected things...that's okay.
You may only work with the same character 2 times in a row.

### Work in teams?

-   Take turns.
-   Everyone participates
-   All ideas are good.
-   Everyone has to agree.
-   If you can't agree, find another idea.
