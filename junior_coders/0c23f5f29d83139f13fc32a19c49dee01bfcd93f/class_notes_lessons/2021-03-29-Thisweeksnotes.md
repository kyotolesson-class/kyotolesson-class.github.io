### Recap for March 25th


ScratchJr.
  : Today I introduced the Walking Cat Project to one student. It has a walking cat, infinite motion, lots of waits to control timing, messages to control the action and make a conversation, bringing together skills students have learned recently.

Tynker
  : Today students worked mostly on tutorials. One student had a problem with the cake decoration game because her stamp didn't seem to work. This was likely due to a bug in Tynker on ipads, and not the student's code, which was correct. Working together on it did give her a chance to experience debugging and testing.

### Recap for March 26th

Review and Exploration 
  : Today was a very productive class, with students creating their own project using recent skills. There was a lot of kids teaching kids, which was great. Common threads were using waits creatively and controlling speed.


The Smelly Project
One student told a simple story about a cat and a troublesome smell. This project uses careful timing to tell a story, as well as an invisible scene transition.

Another student shared some projects they had done previously, demonstrating their command of touch buttons, screen  jumps.

Here the child used careful timing to make the car disappear, egg appear, and the cat slice the egg.

Independently a student used some of the ideas from recent projects to make shooting games. Note how the button triggers the release of the second bullet and the player has to shoot without being shot.

There was also this shooting game, with an interesting merge effect between several characters using the bump block.

Quack!
  : For some reason this very simple project got everyone laughing very hard! The quack sound just makes everything funny!

Walking Cat
