### Farewell Party

Next week we will have a small farewell party for one of our students, with, per request, popcorn and jelly beans. It will be low-key, and so students don't need to bring anything special for it, unless they want to.


### Recap for June 21st

#### Project of the Day: Slash Knight

We started out with a review of the game Slash Knight. This game is popular now among the students, and I showed them a EZ version of the game. The purpose was give them some insight into how a real, complete game is coded. I walked through a stepped set of projects showing how the game is build up in stages. These have been collected in this [Studio](https://scratch.mit.edu/studios/29935748/). Here is the simplified game.

{% include zakviewer.html Name="SKEZ (2 level) - template" ID="https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/544335258/" caption="" %}

We then showed how (relatively easy it is) to add a new level to my simplified game by making a group project.

{% include zakviewer.html Name="SKEZ (3 level) Group Work" ID="https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/546680246/" caption="" %}

Adding a level is easy.

1. Find the 3 `ADD NEW LEVEL here::custom`{: .msb}  blocks. There is one in the KNIGHT, the door, and the interactives(heart). Add just above it a block similar to this one:

```
if <(the number of the level we are on) = [3]> then // In this case 3, 
set [x v] to [-120] // change this to the new starting x 
set [y v] to [48] // and y
end
```
{: .msb}


SKEZ with green knight and bus
  : Student H started his own mod of my SKEZ project. He changed the KNIGHT to a green guy, and the door for a bus. 

{% include zakviewer.html Name="green knight and bus" ID="https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/546697575" caption="Next stop, adventure!" %}

Independence and Creativity
  : Student A finished some projects on her own last week. Great Job! Her creativity is wonderful.

For the Animal Contest, I helped her add a tts voice.

{% include zakviewer.html Name="Animal Contest" ID="https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/546686958/" caption="Nice mix of effects. Click the character or press any of space, up arrow, or 'a' to play" %}

Here there is some nice storytelling.

{% include zakviewer.html Name="Animal School" ID="https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/546363712" caption="Nice change of backdrop!" %}

She also worked on the Chase Game tutorial today.

{% include zakviewer.html Name="Chase Game" ID="https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/546695203" caption="" %}




Busy Busy
:   Student M was quite busy today. He started by adding some music to his my Explosion Game.

{% include tynkerprojectpage.html Name="My Explosion" ID="https://www.tynker.com/play/my-explosion/60a2252a80d8ae28ef4d39bd-615569XvCnThKOYDo,Ri1Vo9qWo2Uk" caption="" %}

Then he completed the Falling Trails   and Cats and Dogs tutorials

{% include tynkerprojectpage.html Name="" ID="https://www.tynker.com/play/falling-trails/60d05eeafe3eea3e5c666e57-996147Xguh98QU1XJvYwnyutvOv4Ak" caption="" %}

Finally, he even put in some work on Space Cowboy

{% include tynkerprojectpage.html Name="Space Cowboy" ID="https://www.tynker.com/play/space-cowboy/60d065a21c374747b51a999c-639273Xt6771UM,ATWD7r6Tumt6EYk" caption="" %}

Wrong Pong Strong Pong
  : Student A added another paddle to his Pong Project. He got a little stuck because his paddles were moving in all sorts of directions. A quick explanation of  `point in direction ()`{: .msb} soon fixed that. 

{% include zakviewer.html Name="" ID="https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/546207368/" caption="Nice Game over screen! Use the arrow and w/s keys to move the paddles." %}

Cheesy Show and Tell
  : We also had a new student today, who will be joining us for a few weeks. They (preferred pronoun) made their first scratch project today, but it was a hit during today's show and tell. We worked together on making the letters flash. Great first project. 

{% include zakviewer.html Name="cheeseland dancing cricket center" ID="https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/546680316/" caption="" %}



#### Show and Tell

Several student, who had been working very hard on various projects the past few weeks, shared their projects at the end of class today.

This Ghost Can Dance
  : Student H made a dance project. His challenge was making the dancing stop when the music stopped. Using the repeat until block with a flag (variable) accomplished this. Here is the Ghosts' code:

```
when @greenFlag clicked
set [stopped music v] to [0] // initialize  variable
broadcast [message1 v]
play sound [Dance Around v] until done
set [stopped music v] to [1] // set flag

when I receive [message1 v]
repeat until <(stopped music) = [1]> // test flag
    next costume
    wait (1) seconds
end
```

when I receive [message1 v]
repeat (15)
    next costume
    wait (1) seconds
endH
```
{: .msb}

Spooky Sounds
  : Getting a (very) head start on Halloween, Student M worked on a spooky sounds project. He animated each actor using animate blocks and set part blocks.

Code a Cartoon
  : Student A has completed several projects for the Scratch Beginner'S Challenge, including the Animate My Name and Code a Cartoon.

This is an old project she did a long time ago.

{% include zakviewer.html Name="Elegant Animate My Name" ID="https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/427349997/" caption="This Animate My Name is quite clever." %}


Today, she worked on the Code a Cartoon Remix. After setting up the initial project, we added initializations and animation block sets.

```
when @greenFlag clicked // initialization
go to x: (-197) y: (-104)

when this sprite clicked
repeat (10) // simple animation
    next costume
    wait (.1) seconds
end
```
{: .msb}


{% include zakviewer.html Name="Code a Cartoon Remix" ID="https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/541287336/" caption="We also added click actions, such as for the superhero.
 
```
when this sprite clicked
change y by (100)
wait (0.2) seconds
change y by (-100)
start sound [Kelsey-Haha v]
say [This is fun!] for (2) seconds
```
{: .msb }

<span>" %}{% comment %}for some reason we need a span here because of the scratchblock, perhaps!{% endcomment %}

2 Great Projects
  : Student A2 was able to complete two tutorials. Animate My Name included sequencing with messages, clickable letters, a background change, random positions, and sounds. A fine project!

{% include zakviewer.html Name="Animate My Name Plus Alpha" ID="https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/541288180/" caption="Click the letters for more actions." %}


The second was a Make Music tutorial. The crowd sounds make this project fun. 

{% include zakviewer.html Name="Make Music Tutorial with extras" ID="https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/541319256" caption="Click the sprites to hear the sounds. The Singer moving over to the right is a nice touch as well." %}

{% include tynkerprojectpage.html Name="The Cow Comes Back" ID="https://www.tynker.com/play/cow-joke/60b4a6d9ff76927f9549307c-928211Xk.v5BbKXkc5Fjh9zM,CZDYk" caption="He finished the story by making the Cow comes back!" %}

User Friendly Messages
  : Student H worked first on the Animate my Name tutorial. At first the characters did not appear in sequence. We talked about using more user friendly message names, and he was able to make it work. He also added motions and sounds on clicks, to make the project more interesting.

{% include turbowarp.html Name="Animate My Name" ID="https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/425309020" caption="Don't touch the letter G, you will regret it." %}


While starting a text-to-speech project, he also played around with the sprite editor to create some funny characters.

change [Score v] by (0)
forever // ball makes sound
    play sound [Dance Funky v] until done
end




when @greenFlag clicked 
forever
    if <touching [Ball v]?> then // stop music and say game over
        stop all sounds

My Favorite Things
  : Student A has finished the first round of his "My Favorite Things" project. After looking at it, I suggested some improvements, especially to have more things happen during the presentation times, which he added.

{% include tynkerprojectpage.html Name="My Favorite Things" ID="https://www.tynker.com/play/my-favorite-things/6096039467a5911837198325-505513Xr1l0wHQPl9X7nOYSm5yP.Yk" caption="" %}

I like his version very much, and I was inspired to come up with an alternative version of his sections to show how animation and other effects can be used. I hope to discuss it more next week.


{% include tynkerprojectpage.html Name="Revised Favorite Things" ID="https://www.tynker.com/play/my-favorite-things-5-24-improveed/60ab89cf560d5004eb78391c-811626XuHxiHkxE9eZ9jV11vivbPYk" caption="" %}


Pinball and using **When** blocks
  : Student A did the Pinball game tutorial. The project is a little advanced, but she was able to complete it. The main tool was using **When** blocks that perform actions at the right moment.

![Imgur](https://i.imgur.com/TpwsvQo.png){: .jsgif}
  : * The touching , set viewport, and apply impulse blocks are used to send the ball flying. 


![Imgur](https://i.imgur.com/mQkRtV6.png){: .jsgif}
  : * Each award or bumper or actor has a different actions attached to it that ball collides with it, it reacts.


Environment Video

### Saving Trees
Student H was very excited that he had a new idea for a project involving a conversation about the importance of planting trees for global warming. I encouraged him to write his script first before coding and he diligently put together script and chose images to illustrate the conversation. As class closed he began to code it.

{% include turbowarp.html Name="Saving Trees" ID="531547089" caption="" %}


We talked about the difference between using plain say ```say [] ```{: .msb style="display: inline-block; height: 0px;"} and ```say () for () seconds```{: .msb style="display: inline-block; height: 0px;"} blocks. He decided to use the former. We also talked about whether to broadcast ```broadcast ()```{: .msb style="display: inline-block; height: 0px;"} to go between speakers, or to use say and wait ``` wait () seconds ```{: .msb style="display: inline-block; height: 0px;"} blocks. He again decided on the former.
<br><br>
```
when @greenFlag clicked
say [its so hot...] for (3) seconds
wait (4) seconds
say [why do we need to plant more trees !?!?] for (5) seconds
wait (15) seconds
say [yeah right blah blah blah] for (3) seconds
```

My Explosion
 : Student M worked on improving his two-player shooting game. We made it so that the bad ships could move 

![Imgur](https://i.imgur.com/w3HZEtk.jpg){: .jsgif}

and that when the ships die they can't shoot any more. This required creating a variable and testing the variable to keep track of whether the actor was alive or not. 

![Imgur](https://i.imgur.com/MiXdGZ0.jpg){: .jsgif}
![Imgur](https://i.imgur.com/nm5SwEC.jpg){: .jsgif}

I made several suggestions for improvements to the project, but in the end he came up with his own: there will be a heart and if one ship touches the heart the other ship has to hit them more times before they die. We began this by creating another variable. Also, we will make it so you can continue to play after dying.

![Imgur](https://i.imgur.com/v6fB9oj.png){: .jsgif}

We will continue working on this next week.

### Recap for May 9th

My Favorite Things
  : Student A1 worked adapted the "My Favorite Things" project focusing on his favorite things: Blue, Golf, and Korean Food. The project is still incomplete, but the section on Korean food is working.
  
{% include tynkerprojectpage.html Name="05 11 My Favorite Things" ID="https://www.tynker.com/play/05-11-my-favorite-things/60998bf30381e277a77bbb74-348138Xkq1kH5Cm1FI2LoHeTOoiIck" caption="" %}


Comic Book Project
  : Student A2 is working on her comic book project. We worked very closely to make the characters reappear in the second panel and then make the characters choose the right costumes, talk and move. She is becoming more comfortable using messages to sequence activities, but needed to be reminded to give each message a unique name. 

![Imgur](https://i.imgur.com/8MEvYl9.png){: .jsgif}

{% include tynkerprojectpage.html Name="Comic Book" ID="[ID](https://www.tynker.com/play/comic-2/60998a2851664a207b702339-436607XpCn7VEjF9rdOksv37WZlc8k)" caption="The main characters hide and then reappear in the second panel." %}

Rocket Ship Game
  : With Student M started a new project. First he did a project that was mostly about making as much noise as possible. This students is very creative at working with stock actors and I tried to lead him in a direction involving more direct coding and modifications to the stock code, and came up with a project about two ships shooting at each other. Below is a sample of how that game might work. This is still mostly stock code, but the critical change is that the explosion should happen only if the character is hit by the correct laser, not by just *any* actor:

![Imgur](https://i.imgur.com/nRC0aSI.png){: .jsgif style="width:200px"} &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ![Imgur](https://i.imgur.com/tqxB5Y4.png){: .jsgif style="width:200px"} 
  : * Default condition is "**touching &lt;any&gt;**", but we want "**touching &lt;green laser&gt;**"

Hopefully next class I will be able to develop this project more, such as into a two person game.

Among Us 
  : Student H continued working on a Scratch project. He imported some Among Us characters, and we removed the background using the [Pixlr online tool](https://pixlr.com/remove-background/). We made the character appear to walk by switching costumes using code like this:
```
when @greenFlag clicked
go to x: (0) y: (0)
repeat (10)
    next costume
    move (10) steps
    wait (.2) seconds
end
```
{: .msb}

The student was challenged to explain why the the character was starting in the middle of the screen, and we talked about how to find the x and y coordinates of a character. Change the goto does the trick:

```
go to x: (-275) y: (0)
```
{: .msb}

### Recap for April 26th

Back to Scratch
  : Some kids moved back to Scratch after a long time with Tynker. I had loosely offered this a while back, and the kids have asked for it since then. This will allow us to focus more on details and specific steps. 

Virus Shooting
  : Student H continued working on his Virus Shooting Project. Today we worked in the photo editor making his character into a silhouette but cutting part out, and painting over it. Then we moved to coding. We worked on making the gun follow the mouse pointer and limiting the motion to certain directions. This required 2 if block, an a condition block to test tthe diretion and point in the right direction.


```
when @greenFlag clicked
forever
    point towards [mouse-pointer v]
    if <(direction) > [20]> then
        point in direction (20)
    end
    if <(direction) < [-41]> then
        point in direction (-41)
    end
end

when I receive [message2 v]
play sound [Squish Pop v] until done

when @greenFlag clicked
forever
    say (direction)
end

```
{: .msb}

{% include turbowarp.html Name="Virus Shooter" ID="517634593" caption="The spraygun's motion is limited to between -30 and 35 degrees" %}


Tutorials
  : Student M worked in Tynker. As a warmup, he made mouse follow the mousepointer and a cat follow the rat . He made the game stop if the cat caught the mouse. The key was using touching blocks, with forever loops  to do the testing

```
when @greenFlag clicked 
forever
    glide (1) secs to [Mouse1 v]
end

// Cat follows mouse


when @greenFlag clicked 
forever
    go to [mouse-pointer v]
end

// Mouse follows pointer


when @greenFlag clicked 
forever
    if <touching [Cat v]?> then
        say [help] for (2) seconds
        stop [all v]
    end
end

// when touched game stops
```
{: .msb}

{% include turbowarp.html Name="mouse run" ID="521123023" caption="" %}


Pong
  : Then he finished a tutorial for a pong like game. We experimented with different rebound angles for the ball, e.g. 200 degrees instead of 180 degrees.


```
when @greenFlag clicked
forever
    if <touching [Magic Wand v]?> then
        change [score v] by (1)
        turn @turnRight (200) degrees::motion // 200 degrees instead of 180 degrees
        move (15) steps
        wait (0.5) seconds
    end
end
```
{: .msb}


{% include turbowarp.html Name="Pong" ID="521128840" caption="" %}


### Makeup Class
There was also a makeup class.

Joke Game
  : Student A1 finished his comic strip joke class. He added more characters and conversation, as well as a cute "Fin" end card. The project is below but beware, the volume is high, so turn it down before you play the project.

{% include tynkerprojectpage.html Name="Joke" ID="https://www.tynker.com/play/joke/607e7e767499e620f9630a0c-610559XroM3d00DC4i3IC,ulTdk.Yk" %}



Comic 
  : Student A2 was also working on a comic. This time we revised it 

We moved the font and color information to a separate initializion block

![Imgur](https://i.imgur.com/BugB9tz.png){: .jsgif}


We talked about loops. For example, we used a loop to move the caveman towards the karate kid and to change the karate kid's costume while he kicks. We counted the number of costumes so that we would end on a high kick.

![Imgur](https://i.imgur.com/3JC5plC.png){: .jsgif .autoimage}
![Imgur](https://i.imgur.com/OJpPkM8.png){: .jsgif .autoimage}

We also used a broadcast to hide the Karate Kid and the Caveman at the end.

Here is the final product

### Recap for April 19th

#### In-person class

Virus Shooter
  : I worked on a game with student H. We planned out the game, which involves a character shooting spray paint at bad guys. I asked what the overall goal of the game was, and he said there was no real goal but to go around shooting people. However, after a while he came up with an idea involving exterminating a virus. We got to the point where we designed the main character, a villain, and a paintgun. He wanted to do some modifications on a stock character so we learned to use the image editor to flip elements, and group and ungroup elements.

This is a mockup of what part of the project might look like once we are finished:

{% include turbowarp.html Name="Virus Shooter" ID="517893944" %}

Witch and Goblins game
  : I prompted Student M to come up with a story for his project, and to try ot develop more variety in his games. He came up with a new game idea involving a wizard, some goblins trying to capture a village, and boss goblins. The goal is to capture a treasure, and we worked together how to make music play when the treasure is touched. I again suggested developing the story more, such as adding more options and actions in the game, and adding other characters or other possible actions for the wizard. This is something we will continue to work on. 

{% include tynkerprojectpage.html Name="Goblin Die" ID="https://www.tynker.com/play/goblin-die/604b2c86bcbcb33a3a652501-717565XiM.YNyCpQ1Xsg9SMr8cXJMk" %}

### Zoom class

We also had a Zoom class for some students who couldn't attend the in-person class. The students worked on doing the **Comic Strip** tutorial, which students were invited to do and modify.

Student A decided to make the strip a series of jokes. On his own he used message blocks to make the conversation, but the result was somewhat flat. I prompted him to make the page more dynamic, for example including adding animation when they speak, and movements. He began doing that and the result is better, and will continue for homework.

{% include tynkerprojectpage.html Name="Joke (remix)" ID="https://www.tynker.com/play/joke/607e7e767499e620f9630a0c-807272Xlxzv7p5j8nl5uRaBlyGN68k" %}


A second student A had some questions about the text bubbles, such as the set pen size, color, and set font blocks, so we walked through an explanation of what the blocks did and created some examples of various settings. The student also learned about the difference between a **plain say block** and a **say for X seconds** block. Then we added an animation using a next costume loop. 

{% include tynkerprojectpage.html Name="Comic" ID="https://www.tynker.com/play/comic/607e81cc46dc2f545e4ad525-549194Xr6y..w4RWHz5PD.90gMXSwk" %}

## April 12th

Today we had 2 kids attending via Zoom. I gave kids feedback on their projects from last week and made suggestions for further steps. 2 of the kids took me up on this, and 2 started new projects.

Dance Party
  : For the dance party he added face movement when the character was speaking, and keys to press to adjust the background, as well as an instruction screen.


{% include tynker.html Name="Dance Party" ID="607401d9d9a06f67ed14d15b" %}

Three Little Codeys
  : One student was prompted to come up with a story to go with her project. Her story involved 3 little pigs (aka Codeys) who meet 3 bad guys. They are scared when they see the bad guys, so we programmed this into the characters. Then she decided to add a new level, and we tried to copy the actors from the first level using the backpack. For some reason this didn't work, so we  added new characters by using tynker and copied the code using the backpack. Her homework was to finish telling the story.

{% include tynker.html Name="Three Little Codeys" ID="607401cf2cb8fe6f4f607900" %}

Platformer:
  : One child continued working on his platformer project. He got stuck with a character who disappeared and I helped him locate his current coordinates and make a character show who has been invisible.

{% include tynker.html Name="Platformer" ID="6074145b139a1e11855c1bdf" %}

Animated Butterfly
  : We began to work on his game, but he decided he wanted to check out Scratch again. We suggested the idea of poriting  a project from Tynker to Scratch. He chose the among us project, and we talked about how to make animation from individual costumes. He made a simple animation for his project.

### Recap for April 5th

Students were not able to agree on a project to work on together, so they started out on individual projects.

Helicopter Shooting Game
  : The biggest challenge of the day was a student who wanted to make a shooting game, only without using the pre-set shoot and attack blocks. While it is easy to just use the pre-set blocks, when you want to control things carefully, you sometimes have to build it on your own. We worked out together on the whiteboard the exact steps that shooting a bullet would involve:

1. Triggering the action (when pressed)
2. Appearing in the right place (go to and show)
3. Moving to the next place (glide)
4. Detecting contact (touching?)
5. Reacting to the content (send and receive message)

We then converted this into basic blocks. We created the bullet and then a new costume to show the enemy had been shot. Here is sample code (with errors to be fixed):

![Imgur](https://i.imgur.com/rAztuI7.png){: .jsgif}

![Imgur](https://i.imgur.com/m2HRTMb.png){: .jsgif .autoimage}

After a false start involving clones, we simplified to one helicopter at first. When we got it working, we had one very excited student! The next step would be to add more helicopters.


{% include tynker.html Name="Helicopter Shooting Game" ID="606aca1653b07445784897a0" %}

Pet Simulator
  : This student decided she wanted to redo the pet simulator project. This was great, cause we realized she didn't quite understand where the location of the costumes was, and how to test when two characters are touching. Once she understood this, she was able to add the cupcake on her own. Apparently, the face doesn't like cupcakes.

![Imgur](https://i.imgur.com/wfJMbRu.png){: .jsgif} 

{% include tynker.html Name="Pet Simulator" ID="606ad4aeec926e63ac1d4c0a" %}

Platformer Game
  : She then decided to try her hand at a platformer game. This went swimmingly until she realized she wanted to delete the horde of bad guys she had put there first. Unfortunately in Tynker you have to laboriously delete each character. Now it is much more manageable.

{% include tynker.html Name="Platformer Game" ID="606add3c15183a5a9c6c29ea" %}

Dance Party
  : Another student decided to work on a dance party. This is pretty straightforward, and a work in progress.

### Recap for March 29th

Today was an interesting class. The kids spontaneously decided to hold an impromptu coding contest after seeing one student's project. We all started out with the same basic project.

{% include tynker.html Name="Student Challenge for March 29th" ID="60618e1a410546550141113c" %}

The challenge was to do something to modify the project to make it better. Students worked individually and we ended up with three different projects. We then scored the projects according to different criteria 

    1. Creativity
    2. Originality
    3. Hard Work
    4. Visual Effects
    5. Easy to use and understand
    6. Music

and kids talked about which criteria each project did best on. Here are their projects.

### Recap for March 22nd

Fun Meanie Project  
  : One student, as in the project we reviewed in the February 22nd class, wanted a door that would open when the actor collected a coin. This time, instead of a coin, he wanted to make it a person. 

The meanies are in a trap, but we want to open the trap when the actor collects the collectable. We use **the set tile at point** block to initialize the stage at start, and then we send a message when the collectable is collected to set the tiles to empty when the character is collected. 


![Imgur](https://i.imgur.com/FqAXFaB.jpg){: .jsgif}

{% include tynker.html Name="Fun Meanie Project" ID="603a374854eef562025fc725" %}

Road Crossing
  : This student modified the Chicken Crossing game to make it a Road Crossing game. I challenged her to make the game more different/interesting by adding a third road. This allowed me to show her how to add levels and use the Tynker backpack to move code from one level or project to another.


{% include tynker.html Name="Road Crossing" ID="604f2cfef14fce64b42e9f7b" %}

Gangnam Style
  : Another student was able to finish his project, which involved making a character dance in Gangnam Style. sing animate blocks. He planned out the motions on paper and by looking at the available animations. The class enjoyed an impromptu dance session and learning what Gangnam meant from a student of Korean descent.

{% include tynker.html Name="Gangnam Style" ID="605861d9094f013b6b6674aa" %}

Working at home
  : Another student demonstrated projects he had finished at home recently. He really has been able to learn a lot just by exploring on his own, and was delighted to share his discoveries with me and the other students. One important discovery for him was that you can copy all the code from one actor, like a stock actor, to your own actor to make them behave the same. He had a lot of fun switching characters to give them unexpected behavior.


&#127775; 1. Zonbi
  : The first project was inspired by another student's Zombie game. The Zombie is a modified stock villain. I showed him how to add levels and use the backpack. He then added a top down maze level.

{% include tynker.html Name="Zonbi" ID="604c254053b3cd09ca20c000" %}


&#127775; 2. Torening
  : The student was very proud of his modified stock actors as well as various tile types in this project.

{% include tynker.html Name="Torening" ID="604c39466920982ccb33dde7" %}

&#127775; 3. Rush
  : This project involves multiple heros and using "a" to attack.

### Homework due March 22nd

Individually assigned.

### Recap for March 15th

Today was quiz day. I made a general quiz that involved making a **Me Super ninja Jump Heart Ninja Dinosaur Volcano** (they chose the name) project together.

Kids took turn answering questions. Questions were easy or hard, depending on the individual level. In addition to reviewing simple concepts like hiding, the questions were aimed at making them think, or leading them towards new concepts, such as shortcuts for adding backgrounds and using **point in direction** blocks.

![Imgur](https://i.imgur.com/sLGS2uC.png){: .jsgif}

The final challenge was to make the Ninja jump over a tree. Because this game didn't have the platformer module installed, they had to figure out how to make the character jump directly, which was new for some kids used to **jump** blocks. 


It was fun to see the kids get very excited when they suddenly had an insight or figured out the answer. We will probably revisit this project soon but here it is in its unfinished state. Press right arrow or up arrow to move, and "j" to jump over the tree.

### Recap for March 8th

Today kids worked on their own projects. 

Platformer Game: Making a Bad Guy React to an Approaching Good Guy
  : Platformers are still popular, but kids are now starting to want to customize their games more. 

{% include tynker.html Name="Making a Bad Guy React to an Approaching Good GuyME" ID="603cb6e0a3e768462a1caa4f" %}

One question that came up for several students was how to make the bad guy react when the good guy is near. For example, the bad guy could tell him about the presence of awards and bad guys, or could make clones of himself, or give a riddle to be solved. 

![Imgur](https://i.imgur.com/bV3fU0Y.png){: .jsgif}
  : * A **when [] occurs** holding a  **distance to []** block can detect the good guy, and then we can code our reaction.

{% include tynker.html Name="Making a Bad Guy React to an Approaching Good Guy" ID="603a374854eef562025fc725" %}

Brickbreaker
  : Another student worked hard on a classic brickbreaker game. The tutorial she was working off of was rather fast and hard to follow, so we walked through it together. It involved the very difficult concept of nested loops. We also reviewed static and active blocks, and true versus false.

{% include tynker.html Name="The brickbreaker game is a classic game!" ID="6046e39fa763df276940ef2c" %}

![Imgur](https://i.imgur.com/2jQj6wh.png){: .jsgif}
  : * **This loop** draws the bricks. It draws all the columns in one row and then the next. Getting the numbers right is tricky.


![the paddle is active](https://i.imgur.com/mkTMsa0.png){: .jsgif}
  : * **The Paddle is Active and Static** Active means it can feel hits. Static means it doesn't move if it is hit. It doesn't receive "kicks".

![the ball is active, but not static](https://i.imgur.com/HN1QJvb.png){: .jsgif }
  : * **The Ball** can move, and it can receive "kicks" (impulses). Restitution means that it keeps all its energy when it bounces. An friction means it doesn't stick to the paddle.


Doodle Jump
  : Another tutorial was not that difficult but had outdated code in it for making a scoreboard, and I had to create an up-to-date version. Luckily, the newer method is much simpler. Note the nice scoreboard in the final project.

### Recap for March 1st

Project Preview: Among Us
  : Today I looked at platform games, and how to give a character "lives". 
  
Last week a student asked how to make a character come to life again. There are several ways, and this week I showed how to do it using the **set** and **properties** blocks. 

![set lives](https://i.imgur.com/5VETctG.png){: .jsgif}

The homework is to work through the tutorial again on your own, and try to add something new. Here is what it should look like in the end (press s to shoot, and right arrow to move closer). As you can see, the zombie comes back!!

Platform with balloons
  : Today we reviewed the "Platform with balloons" project (based on a student project) and I reviewed with the entire class how to set tiles inside Tynker to make a trap for meanies. 
  
The meanies are in a trap, but we want to open the trap when the actor collects the ring. We use **the set tile at point** block. We initialize it closed at start, and then we change the tiles to empty when the character is collected.

As a modification, kids each chose a different kind of tile, and you can see the result of the code here.

I then showed how to add a character that speaks when another character approaches. Using and **if** block, we check to see if the distance to the main actor is less than 300 pixels. If so, the character says the message. If he is beyond 300 pixels, we say nothing.

In this case the actor tells the main actor that he has to collect a ring before he can attack the green meanies. Here it is everything in live game action.

How to make a character come to life again
  : A student had an interesting question about how to make a character come to life again. Next week we will talk about two ways to do this, but here is a preview:

Debugging Tic Tac Toe 
  : Kids then worked on their ongoing projects. The biggest challenge today was in teh Tic Tac Toe game. This required some debugging by the student, and the student was able to figure it out by themselves once I gave a hint as to where the problem code was. Great Job!!

Keep working on your class project.

### Recap for February 15th

#### Preliminary Activity

We started off with an activity aimed at prompting some positivity and team spirit. Kids went around the room and tried to say one nice thing about one other person. Even though some kids struggled with this, I think it was helpful at getting them to think in those terms. Based on this I talked the positive qualities the kids in this class have. Then I talked about how these qualities can be part of becoming a good coder. I wanted them also to think of themselves as coders.

Qualities that kids in this class have that are also good for coders
  : * Creativity 
  : * Energy and Excitement
  : * Getting in ideas from many places.
  : * Cleverness 
  : * Assiduousness 
  : * Learning independently.
  : * Thoughtfulness
  : * Kindness
  : * Willingness to ask questions and search for answers
  : * Concentration
  : * Working through difficulties
  : * Focus


#### Project Review of the Day (February 15th)

Today we also started a project review series. At the beginning of each class we will spend some time reviewing a project that someone has made. As a class, we will then modify it to see how it works, and how to make it better.

Today's project was the Space Rush game.

{% include tynker.html Name="Space Rush" ID="6021522f326cdc17cf2e10d4" %}

We looked at the code that controls how the Ship moves and adjust ed the the parameters to make the character move faser and more smoothly.

By making how far the ship moves each time larger, the ship moves faster, but less smoothly. By decreasing the wait the ship goes faster:

Likewise for the Moon/Asteroid:

![Imgur](https://i.imgur.com/XTtlYMM.png)


Kids really enjoyed being able to modify the code to see what would happen, especially using "crazy" umbers like zero or 1000000. 

#### Motivation System

To help with motivation in the class I started an bonus points system where kids collect points for positive contributions such as cooperation, teamwork, and concentration and hard work. Ultimately the goal is to add a little fun and a rewards for their had work; given that they are still gaining skills and making mistakes and getting stuck from time to time, the intrinsic rewards of making something work are not as strong.

#### Platformers are popular

This week there was a sudden surge in interest in Platform games. One girl had come up with her own since last week, and another two kids decided to copy her effort!!

### Recap for February 8th

Debugging
  : Today students worked on debugging projects they were working on. 
  
* a Maze project was finished after fixing an error due to a missing minus sign. The student was able to code the 3rd part of the maze all by themselves.
* In order to rename some functions in their code, a student had to reverse engineered the original function to find a suitable rename for it.
* One student is working on an especially creative platform game. They created a Monster Museum and a special monster "cage" that opens when the character collects a certain coin. There was a bug where the tiles that make the door of the cage disappeared when the project was run. We reused a trick from last week to redraw the tiles when the program starts. We also talked about the goal of their project, and make a bunch of balloons appear when the hero collects the final star, which you can see at the end of this sample play.

{% include tynker.html Name="Monster Museum" ID="60216ff63c0daf6d42090fd5" %}

* Another student had a problem with the Space Rush Game. One of the asteroids wouldn't disappear, and there was not score. We started to discuss why this was happening and next week we will fix it. 
* We worked on a Walk in the Park Game but Tynker's project template was set up for a tablet, so we had to figure out how to modify some of the code so it would work on a pc. Instead of changing the x-tilt:

![Imgur](https://i.imgur.com/REnzivA.png){: style="height: 80px;width: auto;" .jsgif}

we had to change the x-position.

Fun
  : For fun some students worked on making their own minecraft mods, which is a home feature of Tynker.

### Recap for February 1st

Space Rush
  : One student wanted to take aa project and change the main character. We had already discussed importing actors, and today we talked about how to make animations with characters. There was also a problem with the "teleport" effect (when the actor leaves the screen at one side and comes back on the other side.) This requires testing for when the actor leaves one edge, and then sending them to opposite edge.

 ![Imgur](https://i.imgur.com/VE7LjNL.png){: .jsgif}

{% include tynker.html Name="Space Rush" ID="600e8c3d4359961a9571f83a" %}

Among Us
  : The student was very ambitious. They worked on planning the next stage of their an Among Us game. Watching another student, they were also inspired to start their own Platform game. 

Initializing Tiles
  : In a platform game this student was working on, certain tiles disappear if you captured a certain token. We noticed this week that if you restart the game the tokens remain disappeared. To fix this we had to make sure the tokens are drawn when we start. In the initialization below, one of the tiles has been changed to show which tiles were being changed.

![Imgur](https://i.imgur.com/Kfd993M.png){: .jsgif}

Maze
  : One student made a maze based on a tutorial. Some special modifications included:
  
  : * vary the speed of the motion by changing a wait block.
  : * initialize the size of the actor at the start

  : In the example below, click the mouse to move the tiny fish.

Watch it here:

{% include tynker.html Name="Maze" ID="6017cb9e365a4a4c562b881a" %}


Tic Tac Toe
  : The Tic Tac Toe project continues. 
  
  : The current task is changing the code to use ```switch to  background () :: looks```{: .msb}  instead of ```hide :: looks```{: .msb} for the squares. 
  
  : We decided that to change the code simultaneously on all the squares it is better to make one actor the way we want and duplicate the actor.  
  
  : On the way there, I suggested to the student that it is very helpful to give meaningful names to messages. The student worked on renaming all their messages to more meaningful ones. This involved a bit of debugging to figure out just what each message was doing. This was a very good exercise in analyzing code. 

  In the end, there is still one little piece that isn't working, and they still have to copy all the actors, but all in all they did very good work.

### Recap for January 25th 

Platformer Game
  : Student finished shooting game and the other students had a lot of fun playing the game. It was very challenging, and everyone had fun trying to beat the game. The student really enjoyed explaining all the special features of the game.

{% include tynker.html Name="Platformer Game" ID="5ff2d7d79b253560ca4078b5" %}

Pet Project and Art Studio
  : The student finished up the last part of their Pet Project. We looked at some other projects together and found one she would like. For this Art Studio we worked through sending and receiving a message to change the costume of the pen actor when the colored squares are clicked. The student added some actors and tried to recreate the code, and we focused on making sure the new names and references were right. 

{% include tynker.html Name="Art Studio" ID="6005537ab7669807061233e8" %}

Tic Tac Toe
  : The student made a lot of progress on this project today. First we had a problem locating the position of the actors. Due to a quirk in Tynker, hidden AND blank characters are not visible or clickable even when not running the program, so you need to make the character visible by changing costume. In the code, therefore, instead of showing and hiding the characters, we changed the costumes to blank instead. 
  : Having done that, we then placed the actors in the right position and renamed them.
  : Then, we started making the code that would allow us to click the square to make it X or O. 
  : The student quickly understood that we need a variable "who the player is".
  : After creating that variable, we initialized it and created the if else loop that tests to see who the player is before changing the costume.
  : All in all a lot of great work for one day!


First Project
  : A student working on their first Tynker project. They learned how to import costumes into Tynker but had a problem uploading the actor's costume. We learned that you must make sure you download as jpg/png and not as html.


Haunted House/Among Us
  : I revised the Haunted House project a bit so that it would be faster, and the student was quite pleased. However, they had started on another project and were having a problem making the character disappear. It turned out the code was correct, but they had typed the name of the actor into the space and probably had a typo or extra space. We learned that it is usually better to click from the drop down menu if one is offered.

Keep working on projects. 

### Recap for January 18th


Tutorials, First Project
  : Some students worked mostly on tutorials. One student started his first project. The first thing he wanted to do was import some pictures of his favoriete character to use as actor, so I showed him how to do this. 

Hugh
  : I showed one student the proof-of-concept Haunted House Project from last week's notes. After thinking about it, he gave me some ideas for what he wants to do, and I am going to simplify the project a bit so that he can continue it. In the meantime he came up with some specific ideas for a Top-Down game and began planning and coding it.

Tic Tac Toe
  : The tic tac toe project is coming along very well. The student has on their own created using costumes and message various screens.

  : The project has an opening screen, a character selection and rules selection screen, and a rules screen, as well as the main board. In addition, actors to represent the 9 position on the board are being created. We worked together on solving a problem with the logic for returning to the actor selection screen, and talked about what the position actors would look like. I showed him a demonstration project that gave him an idea of how players cod take turns. This project is full of opportunities for learning.

```
when actor clicked :: events
switch to background (blank1) :: looks
send message [show] to [actor] with []:: events
send message [show] to [actor2] with [] ::events
hide :: looks
broadcast (hide rules) :: events
```
{: .msb}

Here is an incomplete version:

{% include tynker.html Name="Tic Tac Toe" ID="5ffc0b612e79c31472478897" %}


Peep project, and Pet simulator
  : The Peep Nature Walk project turned out to be more difficult than expected. The student made a good effort and learned some things. Here is what it could have looked like:

{% include tynker.html Name="Peep project" ID="6005f50a2e6d82407f707508" %}

Pet Simulator
  : Since it was difficult I gave her the option of trying a new project and she chose the Pet Simulator. This project uses the following series of if statements to choose a different reaction for the pet for each food. 

![pet simulator](https://i.imgur.com/CCwp0qc.png){: .jsgif}

Shooting Game: 
  Another student had a an interesting goal. He wanted to make certain tiles disappear after the player captured a special ring. This is actually quite easy, though it sound difficult to do. The key block is this one:

```
set tile at x: () y: () to (empty) :: looks
```
{: .msb}

After showing the student how to figure out what x and y should be, he was able to complete it himself and continue working on his game.

### Homework due January 18th

Individually Assigned.

### Recap for January 11th

Tic Tac Toe
  : A students is working on a tic tac toe game. We talked about how it should be set up, and the student worked on making an introduction and rules. His homework is to create actors for each of the positions and give each 3 costumes (blank, X, O).

Tutorials
  : One child continues to work on tutorials and needed a little help with understanding if conditionals.

Haunted House
  : The Haunted House project hit a few snags as at first, characters kept "falling" when the program started. Sometimes students, especially creative ones, have problems or questions that are difficult to answer, not because there isn't an answer, but the answer or explanation is long, difficult, uncertain, and so on. This is an example. The answer turns out to depend on the following, among other things:  
  
  : * The "static" and "active" settings. 
  : * The main fact that character in a platform game will fall until he/she hits the either a platform of the bottom of the world. 
  : * The fact that in this case you need to use an invisible platform, and invisible platforms are not available in the basic GUI. You CAN use them, but you have to program them.
  : * You also need to set the world size to an appropriate value, and this depends on the size of the stage and whether the stage is normal, stretched, or tiled.
  : * Lastly, the fact that Tynker's documentation of these is confusing and sparse. 

The following project shows how it works. When it starts, it creates a visible platform. If you press c, it replaces the visible platform with an invisible one that the player can walk on:

{% include tynker.html Name="Haunted House" ID="5ffc1a203ab9a77e703c2363" %}

Platform Game
  : Another student continued to make a complex platform game with various platforms, enemies, and even a dead-end trap. While it is easy and fun to just add new characters to shoot at, I suggested making the game more interesting by adding a story to it, such as a goal or endpoint, or an object to collect. Perhaps next week.


Peep and the Big Wide World
  : Another student kept working on her walk through the forest project. She added a butterfly that followed peep, and then created a conversation between Peep and the butterfly. Her homework is to create other scenarios.

### Homework due January 11th

Keep working on Tutorials and Projects.

### Recap for January 4th


Haunted House
  : One limitation of Tynker is that it only allows one to work in 2-D. One student and I had a long talk about how create a more 3-D effect, is in a POV game. This was  a great conversation as it really helps to understand what can and can't be done, and how to use what you can do in creative ways. For example, to do this in Tynker, you would need to create a separate costume for each position and orientation of your character. Tynker has a tiling feature that allows characters to move smoothly in a plane, but not "in or out" of the plane. However, if you imagine that this flat plane is curved around in a circle, you can create a kind of panorama effect. When the character moves it appears are if they are turning around. Using the panorama app on your camera you can instantly create panorama. The hard part is **drawing** panoramas. This was a great question even though the answer, ultimately, was no,, you can't create that type of game in Tynker. 

Tutorials
  : One student worked through some tutorials, including a challenging one about navigating a maze.  She chose her next project, which is based on a project from [Peep and the Big Wide World](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCPq6g4Q4-SFMIJ048IXmupA). 
  
{% include tynker.html Name="Peep" ID="5ff176f0657ea54613390f5b" %}
  
By the way:
  : Peep and the Big Wide World is a great show for kids and I heartily recommend it.

{% include youtubelazy.html  videoID="PEqp2bnbURA" %} 
{: .jsgif}
    
New Student
  : We welcomed a new student. After some quick setup, the student started in on the beginner tutorial, which they mostly worked through on their own. They also spent some time getting to know (aka goofing around with) their benchmate, and the other kids in the class. 

Platform Game
  : One student continued working on his platform game. After a bit of encouragement to give his game more of a story, he imagined that in his story, the hero battles a few villains, and finally falls to the ground. On the ground, there is a sign telling him the big boss is "this way". He spent some time with the image editor creating this sign. Where will it go from here? Stay tuned.


    
![](https://i.imgur.com/NAbhiXh.png){: .jsgif}

Another student turned this into a conversation, where one character says "You will die", and the other says "Not if I kill you first!". Using messages, we can make this happen.

### Bridgit

I ended up the class by teaching them a new pen and pencil game called [Gale or Bridgit](http://www.papg.com/show?1TPI). Drawing the game itself is a bit of a challenge, and the game involves strategy and logical reasoning, all good skills for coding.
