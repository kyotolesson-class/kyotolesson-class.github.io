### Recap for December 18th

Today Students all worked on finishing their Christmas Projects. Then we showed them (with the help of a tutorial video) how to join the [STAGE 1 Jr\. Coders Christmas Contest 2021](https://scratch.mit.edu/studios/30730290/):

{% include zakviewer.html Name="SUBMISSION instructions for the 2021 JCCC Jr\. Coders Christmas Contest on Scratch" ID="https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/612642387/" caption="In the next few weeks their projects will be review by some guest commenters (some of my Scratch friends) and the kids will get some positive feedback from them, as well as some follows. Some of the best projects will go on to be features in the Jr. Coders 2021 Christmas Showcase.
" %}

Such competitions are a popular feature in Scratch, and today was a gentle introduction to these and other Scratch social features. The hope is it will motivate them to make better projects by having them think about others looking at their projects.

### Recap for November 22nd

Christmas Project 
  : Today I gave the kids an Christmas project assignment. The project is intended as an assessment of their progress in the class, and after some initial reluctance, the kids seemed on board with it. The project must include the following elements (and related  skills): 

1. - [ ] Must be appropriate to the theme of Christmas and the interesting creative and original

2. - [ ] Include sounds on start and on click (sound block)
 
1. - [ ] Change appearance of characters on events (Looks size and costume block)

3. - [ ] Have sprite speak (Say block)

 
2. - [ ] Have a recorded message on key press (record, play, when key pressed)

4. - [ ] Have 2 different Sprites doing 2 different motions at same time (switching sprites)
 
3. - [ ] Change the background and sprites in that background (backdrop change)

 
4. - [ ] Have a Sprite jump 5 times using glide (Glide, x and y position, repeat loops)

5. - [ ] Have a drum play 3 different beats and change color each time it changes beats (sound, color effects)

6. - [ ] Pick a dancing sprite and change the costume to make it look like they are dancing (import costumes, change costumes)

Some samples, so far.

### General Reminder

It is important for the safety of your children that we have written notice if anyone other than a guardian/parent is to pick up or take responsibility for your child at pickup time. This includes having the child wait with them until you arrive. Please be sure to tell us (in writing, e.g. via line) if you need to allow someone to pickup or take charge of your child. 

### Recap for November 15th

Basic Paint Battle Game
  : Today, some students worked on modifying a basic Paint Battle/Splatton type game.

{% include zakviewer.html Name="PBRR base game 2021 11 15 on Scratch" ID="https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/602449292/" caption="If you press space, a number representing the amount of white appears. The lower this number, the better your score." %}

The goal for them was to add their own character, make the character move randomly around the screen. Then, using the brightness effect, the character should stamp a white outline of itself, which erases any paint blobs beneath it. To do this they use blocks like this:

Student S
  : This version includes two games in one. 

{% include zakviewer.html Name="Student S Paint battle rifle randomized" ID="https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/601619813/" caption="In addition to the splatton type game, you have to avoid the squid. If your mouse touches the squid, the game is over." %}


Student M 
  : He used a house for his character.

Individual Projects 
  : Other students worked on individual projects. 

Sea Bun Pet 
  : Student K is in the process of creating a Sea Bun Pet Game. She is using various when key pressed blocks to do various actions.

Animating a character
  : Student A added an animation to her Mario Game (Like Grey) character. She stumbled at one point because she made the character change costume twice, which undid the action she wanted. That game being finished, she looked for a new project to do.

{% include zakviewer.html Name="Like Grey copy" ID="https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/593059358/" caption="" %}


Ask Block
  : Student K learned how to use the ask block, make a variable to store the value of the answer, and show the answer on the screen. For a while she worked with a drawing tablet, and explored using the paint area functions.


FNF
  : Student H made his movie stop when it reached a certain size, then continue until it was finished by using a repeat until block. He figured out by himself how to switch to the menu screen when the intro movie was finished and show the first character. Well, almost...


Splatoon
  : Student M hacked a Splatoon type project by adding more characters and giving them more powers. He did some debugging when the up arrow motion on his characters stopped moving. Student M know alot about how games are played and how to hack them to make them more playable, his challenge will be on taking those skills and making his own games.

Inventing a new game: Death Ray Variation
  : Student S started with a death ray 
  
{% include zakviewer.html Name="Death Rays" ID="https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/587873991/" caption="This a teacher demo of various rays..." %}

and turned it into a game. He created several "enemy balls" that attack Voldemort by going to edges and gliding towards him. If they touch a death ray, they "die". We did some debugging so that they would return to their original position when hit.

First Platformer
  :  Student J wanted to make a Mario type game. He quickly learned how to make backgrounds and his main sprite. He wanted to edit his background, but couldn'T because it was a bitmap, which led to an attempt at a simple explanation of the difference between bitmap and vector drawing.

Underwater Sea Slug Project 
  : Following on their interest in Sea Slugs, Student K made the beginnings of and undersea themed project. They used pixlr to remove the background from an image of a sea slug. They used a lot of when key pressed and switch backdrop and backdrop changed blocks to control the visible items, and included an instructions page. They also began using the ask block.

Space Shooter 
  : Student S made great strides on his space shooter. We discussed the advantages and disadvantages of using individual sprites and of using clones for this type of project. After thinking about it he chose to use individual sprites, and meticulously copied and verified his code in each one. By using glides instead of move blocks for the balls this project became quite challenging and different than the usual Space invaders game. Other students really enjoyeed watching and playing this game.

Clicker Game and Shooting Game
  : Student S finished his Space Clicker Game, and began a new project. The first challenge in the new game was how to make the balls take random positions only in the upper half of the screen. I encouraged him to define exactly where he wanted the balls to go in words, and as he did it he figured out how to do it.

FNF
  : Student H started out by analyzing several versions of Friday Night Funkin', and making list of resources, actors, events, and features he wanted to include in his own version of the game. After doing that, he began designing his own main character. 


Corrections and Hacks
  : Student M's specialty is hacking existing projects to make them infinitely playable or behave interestingly. Last week he made some changes to one project, but it didn't quite work the way he wanted. This week we worked through how to get the bullets to fly at the right angle by pointing the second shooter in the right direction, and getting the bullet to point in the same direction. He also worked on hacking some more projects. He had gained wide experience on how different games work.

Platformer with Lava
  : Student A picked up on project that you've made quite some time ago we added traps lava and spikes to her project we started out with a simple lava and then we I showed her how to make it appear only on a particular screen when she understood that basic method she then on her own created similar pitfalls on all the other screens

ScratchJr. Music Project
  : Student J in ScratchJr. had an original idea for a music project where a drum of hammer would hit a drum and make a sound. We then expanded this by adding more drums and by making the hammer twirl across the screen

{% include imgurmp4.html link="https://i.imgur.com/8IClyf8.mp4" %}


Soundtrap
  : Student K opened a new Sountrap account and began exploring adding tracks and modifying them to make interesting sounds. Today was mostly an exploration day, and maybe next week we will try some more guided work.

### Recap for October 18th


* Student J worked on developing his ScratchJr. Space Invaders into a story with a game. The story begins with a villain disrupting 2 by-standers. A hero comes and the villain and hero fight (i.e. the Space Invaders game). When the player wins the game, the hero then returns to the bystanders. The coding involved a variety of blocks, including the introduction of the change scene block.


* Student A completed a new String Figures game and began planning her next project.

{% include zakviewer.html Name="Ayatori" ID="https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/582228901/" caption="The student learned how to add project instructions ot the background using the text box control in the paint editor." %}

* Student S continued his Clicker game. This week he added a timer, which involved identifying the places where the timer needed to be reset and where it should be tested to trigger the game over condition. 


* Student H found a model for a project from a modification of the Friday Night Funk Music Rhythm game, and began to recreate the model by importing characters, coding basic movement, and designing his home screen and how it would function. 

{% include zakviewer.html Name="FNF vs. Mickey" ID="https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/586292667/" caption="In addition to this inital coding, he developed a clear set of events and actions for the beginning of his game that he will implement next class." %}


* Student M worked on modifying a Tower Defense game. He added a new character and attempted to recreate the bullet firing event by reusing and modifying code. He began to understand (with a little help) how to identify the relevant pieces of code. As class ended however, he introduced a coding error that will give him a chance to practice troubleshooting next week. This is still a work in progress but an interesting challenge. 


* Student H2 worked on a project inspired by the Battle Cats project. 

* Student K was introduced to using a drawing tablet and made several new characters using it.

### Recap for October 11th

We played a game based on a lecture by [Professor 井本陽久](https://logmi.jp/business/articles/322794). The game consists of a 6x6 grid. Student place a "1" in 6 of the squares. The remaining squares in the grid automatically receive higher number based on the game rules. The goal is to produce the highest possible number in the grid. If the "1"s represent people who have a virus in a room, people who "get sick" (higher numbers) are ones standing next to 2 or more sick people. The later numbers represent people who get sick after so many days. The goal of the game is both to get everyone sick, but as slowly as possible. 

The game is very good for teaching logical thinking, problems solving, concentration, amongst other other mental skills. Kids worked on their own, with some kids being able to beat the minimum score of 6. The game is open ended in that no one knows what the highest possible number is. In fact, after working very hard on it for an hours, student S was able to get to 18, beat the highest number given in the original lecture, 17. I have read that 23 is possible, but have 

In the leftover time, students then also worked on their own projects. Some notable progress included:

* Student J learned how to make messages by adding movement buttons to a ScratchJr. Space Invaders Game.
* Student A began a "string figures" game in Scratch.
* Student S continued his Clicker game.
* Student H contemplated a Carnage Symbiote project.
* Student M worked on a video sensing jukebox:

Drawing
  : Today there was some interest in drawing and costume design.

Student K focused on very detailed drawing of "a bag of flesh". They asked for some help making "tears" and I suggested using variable length/width lines. 

{% include imgur.html title="draw" ID="https://i.imgur.com/umAvVfe.png" caption="" width="200px" height="" spacer="" %}



Somewhat inspired by the above, we installed the Scratch Addons Extension on student H's computer so he could use onionskinning to copy images, and he began to copy images he drew, somewhat inspired by Student K's image. 

{% include imgur.html title="Bag of flesh" ID="https://i.imgur.com/izeWT7Y.png" caption="" height="" width="200px"  spacer="" %}


He also spent some time drawing his own character for a "madness combat deimos" game. The first step will be creating skins and weapons for the player to choose.
Student S  made attractive game over screens for his clicker game. We talked about the relative merits of using individual sprites over costumes, and how to track time in order to decide when the player loses.

{% include imgur.html title="" ID="https://i.imgur.com/tu52quK.png" caption="" width="200px" height="" spacer="" %}

{% include imgur.html title="" ID="https://i.imgur.com/Vl2MPjq.png" caption="" width="200px" height="" spacer="" %}


So close and yet so far.
  : Student S was quite puzzled when his "red ball" character did not disappear at the edge like it was supposed to. 

{% include imgur.html title="" ID="https://i.imgur.com/1Lc6DVi.png" caption="The red ball is right at the edge. Or is it??" width="200px" height="" spacer="" %}

It turned out, after being led on many false trails, that the ball was exactly 1 pixel off from the edge, just not quite close enough to register as touching. Despite the trouble, it was a good opportunity to demonstrate some debugging/problem solving strategies.


Hacking
  : Students M, H, and A explored projects in Scratch in search of ideas for future projects. They hacked the health points of projects so they could play indefinitely. Student M also added more music to his music jukebox.

Making It Rain
  : Student J started making a Space Invaders game in ScratchJr. He made 31 "dot" characters (we counted) and we worked together to make the dots behave like rain by using move blocks, a message block, some speed blocks, and some infinite loop blocks.

### Recap for September 27th

Today we started out by taking an bird's eye view of a project, to understand how a project is made from beginning to end.  I briefly reviewed [this breakdown](./../lessons/BattleCats.html). The purpose was to demonstrate:

   * How to think about their projects as a whole. Children sometimes get lost in details or in the early steps of a project, without a clear idea of where the project is heading.
  * At the same time, helping them see how the details need to work together to reach that goal. 
  * How to translate their project ideas from the image in their minds into the object language they are programming in, in this case Scratch. This is a crucial step in coding, but is not merely a question of knowing the object language, but of the previous elements. Developing both of these is what this exercise promoted.
  * This leads to a sense of the importance and benefits of planning games beforehand
  * I also touched on some of the common elements of many games, such as initialization and game over screens, and to begin including them in their games.
  * In addition, I tried to encourage them to focus more on the player experience, which many of our students struggle with or neglect.

After a brief discussion, I had children put away their computer and gave them a sheet of paper. They were asked to write down an overview of their current project incorporating the elements we had talked about. Once they completed this, they could start working on their projects again.

For example:

  * Student A was able to add Money Buttons to a Battle Cats project she had started last week. She also made sure that the player began with no money at the start of the game. 
  * Student S made a concrete plan for his project including a game over screen and a clear way for the player to win or lose based on timing the player's clicks.
  * In addition to planning out their overall game, Student K began planning out a character design stage, including choosing 5 hats, wings and tails. We worked out how many characters she would need to make, as well as how many possible characters could be designed.
  * Student M took an existing project and came up with ideas for adding balloons that would pop out when a character defeated an enemy.
  * Student H plotted out his game including 3 different ways (falling, fighting) the player could lose points, and began designing his characters.
  * Student J came up with an original idea for a ScratchJr Project, a puzzle game. We talked about how this could be done within ScratchJr.'s limitations, and I showed him a trick in the paint screen that would allow him to have his pieces fit together nicely.

In the end I think this was a very successful exercise. It was clear from the way kids proceeded on their projects that they were now thinking more actively and purposefully about their projects, not merely copying code or focusing on one step at a time.

Today kids worked on their own projects. 

One kid finished his Basketball Project. Another made great strides in his clicker game,a test project to test out various blocks and techniques, and apply tricks used in the Pacman Project. This project uses skills such as sending messages, forever loops, my blocks, repeats. 

{% include zakviewer.html Name="Space clicker" ID="https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/562106841/" caption="" %}

Student K explored the sounds interface in the scratch editor, sampling and tweaking a variety of sounds to create bizarre effects.

Some kids who were looking for a new project became interested in Battle Cats project I recently made. The game had one interesting feature: It was programmed to so the player would always lose. This was as an incentive to get kids to want to change it. I encouraged them to open it up and they hacked it right away. 

After playing with it a while they started asking for help making it better and adding other characters and changing the interface. 

{% include zakviewer.html Name="Battle Cats simple no shop 2 remix" ID="https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/569638451/" caption="" %}

Lastly, ScratchJr. student J completed a maze project mostly on his own with occasional prompting. We worked on using the drawing interface, especially in drawing straight line and corners. This is a bit buggy in scratch junior so it needs special attention and he did great mastering it. He seemed comfortable with all the parts of this project, and I will give him something more challenging next week.

### Recap for September 6th

Today we (nearly) finished making the basic Mario game based on Grey. We added more levels and made the flag switch the levels.


{% include zakviewer.html Name="Student A" ID="https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/564896769/" caption="Great project!" %}


{% include zakviewer.html Name="Student M" ID="https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/564897209/" caption="" %}

{% include zakviewer.html Name="Student S" ID="https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/564896942/" caption="" %}

One student learned how to change his profile and downsize and image. We talked about the fact that the move block needs to know which direction to move, and that moving in a negative direction moves backwards.

Student K joined us for the first time today. They made a somewhat different version of the game, focusing more on blocks they were familiar with. For example, they struggled with making the cat move up and down, and hardcoded the movement with set y blocks rather than using change y by blocks. They worked on making the cat face in different dirrections.


Instead of levels, they made individual platforms. This is just a different way of doing this project, and a good way to reinforce what you know while building to new skills. Towards the end we added some new blocks, such as if and sensing blocks to test for contact.


{% include zakviewer.html Name="beeps adventure" ID="https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/567151154/" caption="" %}

### Recap for August 30th

Today we worked a group on a very basic platformer project based on a project called Grey.  It includes only the essentials, but it introduces concepts like variables, My Blocks, if blocks to detect keypresses, gravity,  and "pulling up out of the ground" particle physics, and even a little tutorial on drawing triangles. This project forms the basis of most platform and scrolling projects and can be easily modified to suit almost any project.


{% include zakviewer.html Name="Basic Platformer Based on Grey" ID="https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/564896968/" caption="So far we have created the player, added gravity, and pulled the character out of the ground when it falls." %}

We had a lot of kids working on it and once, with some technical issues, a few mistakes by me, and the occasional distraction, so it was slow going. The good news is the hard part is over, and it gets easier from here. Next week we start movement.


Students also worked on individual projects, such as a clicker game, a basketball project, and a shooting game in Tynker.

## August 23rd

Several announcements:
  : The class notes for last weekend are on the website. We have had a lot of makeup classes recently, and, to avoid confusion, let me explicitly state that class notes for your child's makeup classes are on the page for their usual class, not for the day they attended. For example a Monday student who attends a makeup on Friday will have any notes relevant to him/her on the Monday Page. 

  : Since we are heading into another Emergency Period, we will be strictly enforcing our Covid guidelines around hand washing, social distancing and mask wearing, etc. If you could remind your child these are important rules and of the need to cooperate with them that would be helpful. In addition, seating and snack times will be staggered accordingly.

  : We are pleased that for the most part students are focused and attentive during class, and with their cooperation we are creating a fun, relaxed, yet productive learning environment. However, to maintain this, it would be a good time to remind your child that the main activity in class should be working on assignments and projects, i.e. learning to code. I want to avoid ending the day with a child not having made any tangible progress.  Exploring games and playing them, while educational and part of our goal, is better done at home.

  : (To clarify: We do encourage students to explore the many games that Scratch and Tynker make available, and investigating and hacking other projects is a valid part of learning. We also understand the temptation to play them in class is very strong. However, this can easily become a distraction (for them and others) and a gentle reminder from parents would help me better keep these factors in balance. We do provide free time during breaks, and this is not meant as a ban, but a reminder.)

  : Lastly, our class policy is that students should make an effort to communicate, even amongst themselves, in English, as much as practicable, especially during the first section of class. We understand the limitations around this, but we want to be sure this expectation is clearly understood by all so that we can help support them with this. 

### Recap for August 23rd

Student H made an original Basketball project. He was able to code the motion of the ball, including the initial wait with minimal prompting. He began to understand how to connect the idea in his head with the blocks and code in his project.

{% include zakviewer.html Name="Basketball 08 23" ID="https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/562811122/" caption="" %}

Student A continued working on her Pacman project. She added many more pills and ghosts. She was able to figure out by herself how to implement the code so the the ghosts to not go through walls. However they would get stuck on the wall, and with a some very minor help in debugging, she got it working. Great job!

Student M made many modifications to a Tynker Dragon and Choppers Tutorial. He added many more attackers, and also another Dragon. He made the new attackers able to attack new dragon, and created new weapons for the dragon, including a fireball and a bomb, and created keypresses for firing them. We also debugged the bomb to so it wouldn't explode if it was touching the dragon. At first he was merely copying and pasting code, his modifications show an understanding of how the code worked.

Duck Breaks Egg
  : Student S invented his own Duck Breaks Egg game, where the arrow keys are used to make the Duck break the egg. At first one could only break one egg per game. I challenged him to make it so we could press space button to keep playing. We also displayed the score. Once he managed that I challenged him ot make the game progressively harder, such as by changing the speed of the egg's getaway.

Students were given a set of blocks and instructions to turn those blocks into particular actions. For example, these blocks

![Imgur](https://i.imgur.com/8aIbtoh.jpg)

were used to make the actor go up and down and touch the donut:

![Imgur](https://i.imgur.com/YpYX7o5.jpg)

The first test was pretty easy, but the last one required some thinking. I was pleased that they were all able to complete it, with a little help.

After that, kids continued their own projects and tutorials. I also showed them this video sensing project, which inspired at least one kid to develop his own version, which kids enjoyed.

We closed the day with a new game, ["Hackenbush"](http://www.papg.com/show?1TMP=). In addition to being fun, it helps teaches about thinking ahead and basic logic.

### Recap for July 12th


Today's main lesson was to continue the Mario Galaxy 4 project, finishing step 3 and starting step 4. First, students installed an addon to the chrome browser to make it easier to edit in scratch. We added code to go to a new level when the donut is eaten by kuma. We also added some sound, and made the donut move to a new location. 

```
when @greenFlag clicked // in the donut
forever
    if <touching [kuma v]?> then
        start sound [Chomp v]
        broadcast [next level v]
        point in direction (pick random (-179) to (180))
        wait (0.5) seconds
    end
end
```
{: .msb}

We then added a variable called level. We initialized the level, and updated it each time we reached a new level. We learned how to show the level. 

```
when @greenFlag clicked // in the earth, we 
set [Level v] to [1]
switch costume to [earth v]
go to x: (0) y: (0)

when I receive [next level v] // in the earth
change [Level v] by (1) 
next costume
```
{: .msb}

We also briefly touched on how to make characters larger and smaller in the paint editor using the onionskin tool.

### Recap for July 4th

Today we worked as a group on a new project, based on Mario Galaxy 4. I broke the orignal project down into steps, and we walked through them as a group. The kids were really focused and we managed to get through 2 1/2 steps. The kids were able to individualize their projects, and, even if the code is almost the same, each one has a unique character to it.

### Farewell Party

Next week we will have a small farewell party for one of our students, with, per request, popcorn and jelly beans. It will be low-key, and so students don't need to bring anything special for it, unless they want to.


### Recap for June 21st

#### Project of the Day: Slash Knight

We started out with a review of the game Slash Knight. This game is popular now among the students, and I showed them a EZ version of the game. The purpose was give them some insight into how a real, complete game is coded. I walked through a stepped set of projects showing how the game is build up in stages. These have been collected in this [Studio](https://scratch.mit.edu/studios/29935748/). Here is the simplified game.

{% include zakviewer.html Name="SKEZ (2 level) - template" ID="https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/544335258/" caption="" %}

We then showed how (relatively easy it is) to add a new level to my simplified game by making a group project.

{% include zakviewer.html Name="SKEZ (3 level) Group Work" ID="https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/546680246/" caption="" %}

Adding a level is easy.

1. Find the 3 `ADD NEW LEVEL here::custom`{: .msb}  blocks. There is one in the KNIGHT, the door, and the interactives(heart). Add just above it a block similar to this one:

```
if <(the number of the level we are on) = [3]> then // In this case 3, 
set [x v] to [-120] // change this to the new starting x 
set [y v] to [48] // and y
end
```
{: .msb}


SKEZ with green knight and bus
  : Student H started his own mod of my SKEZ project. He changed the KNIGHT to a green guy, and the door for a bus. 

{% include zakviewer.html Name="green knight and bus" ID="https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/546697575" caption="Next stop, adventure!" %}

Independence and Creativity
  : Student A finished some projects on her own last week. Great Job! Her creativity is wonderful.

For the Animal Contest, I helped her add a tts voice.

{% include zakviewer.html Name="Animal Contest" ID="https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/546686958/" caption="Nice mix of effects. Click the character or press any of space, up arrow, or 'a' to play" %}

Here there is some nice storytelling.

{% include zakviewer.html Name="Animal School" ID="https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/546363712" caption="Nice change of backdrop!" %}

She also worked on the Chase Game tutorial today.

Wrong Pong Strong Pong
  : Student A added another paddle to his Pong Project. He got a little stuck because his paddles were moving in all sorts of directions. A quick explanation of  `point in direction ()`{: .msb} soon fixed that. 

{% include zakviewer.html Name="" ID="https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/546207368/" caption="Nice Game over screen! Use the arrow and w/s keys to move the paddles." %}

Cheesy Show and Tell
  : We also had a new student today, who will be joining us for a few weeks. They (preferred pronoun) made their first scratch project today, but it was a hit during today's show and tell. We worked together on making the letters flash. Great first project. 

{% include zakviewer.html Name="cheeseland dancing cricket center" ID="https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/546680316/" caption="" %}



#### Show and Tell

Several student, who had been working very hard on various projects the past few weeks, shared their projects at the end of class today.

This Ghost Can Dance
  : Student H made a dance project. His challenge was making the dancing stop when the music stopped. Using the repeat until block with a flag (variable) accomplished this. Here is the Ghosts' code:

```
when @greenFlag clicked
set [stopped music v] to [0] // initialize  variable
broadcast [message1 v]
play sound [Dance Around v] until done
set [stopped music v] to [1] // set flag

This is an old project she did a long time ago.

{% include zakviewer.html Name="Elegant Animate My Name" ID="https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/427349997/" caption="This Animate My Name is quite clever." %}


Today, she worked on the Code a Cartoon Remix. After setting up the initial project, we added initializations and animation block sets.

```
when @greenFlag clicked // initialization
go to x: (-197) y: (-104)

when this sprite clicked
repeat (10) // simple animation
    next costume
    wait (.1) seconds
end

User Friendly Messages
  : Student H worked first on the Animate my Name tutorial. At first the characters did not appear in sequence. We talked about using more user friendly message names, and he was able to make it work. He also added motions and sounds on clicks, to make the project more interesting.

{% include turbowarp.html Name="Animate My Name" ID="https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/425309020" caption="Don't touch the letter G, you will regret it." %}

My Favorite Things
  : Student A has finished the first round of his "My Favorite Things" project. After looking at it, I suggested some improvements, especially to have more things happen during the presentation times, which he added.

{% include tynkerprojectpage.html Name="My Favorite Things" ID="https://www.tynker.com/play/my-favorite-things/6096039467a5911837198325-505513Xr1l0wHQPl9X7nOYSm5yP.Yk" caption="" %}

I like his version very much, and I was inspired to come up with an alternative version of his sections to show how animation and other effects can be used. I hope to discuss it more next week.

Pinball and using **When** blocks
  : Student A did the Pinball game tutorial. The project is a little advanced, but she was able to complete it. The main tool was using **When** blocks that perform actions at the right moment.

![Imgur](https://i.imgur.com/TpwsvQo.png){: .jsgif}
  : * The touching , set viewport, and apply impulse blocks are used to send the ball flying.

### Saving Trees
Student H was very excited that he had a new idea for a project involving a conversation about the importance of planting trees for global warming. I encouraged him to write his script first before coding and he diligently put together script and chose images to illustrate the conversation. As class closed he began to code it.

{% include turbowarp.html Name="Saving Trees" ID="531547089" caption="" %}


We talked about the difference between using plain say ```say [] ```{: .msb style="display: inline-block; height: 0px;"} and ```say () for () seconds```{: .msb style="display: inline-block; height: 0px;"} blocks. He decided to use the former. We also talked about whether to broadcast ```broadcast ()```{: .msb style="display: inline-block; height: 0px;"} to go between speakers, or to use say and wait ``` wait () seconds ```{: .msb style="display: inline-block; height: 0px;"} blocks. He again decided on the former.
<br><br>
```
when @greenFlag clicked
say [its so hot...] for (3) seconds
wait (4) seconds
say [why do we need to plant more trees !?!?] for (5) seconds
wait (15) seconds
say [yeah right blah blah blah] for (3) seconds
```
{: .msb}


My Explosion
 : Student M worked on improving his two-player shooting game. We made it so that the bad ships could move 

![Imgur](https://i.imgur.com/w3HZEtk.jpg){: .jsgif}

and that when the ships die they can't shoot any more. This required creating a variable and testing the variable to keep track of whether the actor was alive or not. 

![Imgur](https://i.imgur.com/MiXdGZ0.jpg){: .jsgif}
![Imgur](https://i.imgur.com/nm5SwEC.jpg){: .jsgif}

I made several suggestions for improvements to the project, but in the end he came up with his own: there will be a heart and if one ship touches the heart the other ship has to hit them more times before they die. We began this by creating another variable. Also, we will make it so you can continue to play after dying.

![Imgur](https://i.imgur.com/v6fB9oj.png){: .jsgif}

We will continue working on this next week.

  : Student A1 worked adapted the "My Favorite Things" project focusing on his favorite things: Blue, Golf, and Korean Food. The project is still incomplete, but the section on Korean food is working.

Comic Book Project
  : Student A2 is working on her comic book project. We worked very closely to make the characters reappear in the second panel and then make the characters choose the right costumes, talk and move. She is becoming more comfortable using messages to sequence activities, but needed to be reminded to give each message a unique name.

Rocket Ship Game
  : With Student M started a new project. First he did a project that was mostly about making as much noise as possible. This students is very creative at working with stock actors and I tried to lead him in a direction involving more direct coding and modifications to the stock code, and came up with a project about two ships shooting at each other. Below is a sample of how that game might work. This is still mostly stock code, but the critical change is that the explosion should happen only if the character is hit by the correct laser, not by just *any* actor:

![Imgur](https://i.imgur.com/nRC0aSI.png){: .jsgif style="width:200px"} &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ![Imgur](https://i.imgur.com/tqxB5Y4.png){: .jsgif style="width:200px"} 
  : * Default condition is "**touching &lt;any&gt;**", but we want "**touching &lt;green laser&gt;**"

Hopefully next class I will be able to develop this project more, such as into a two person game.

Among Us 
  : Student H continued working on a Scratch project. He imported some Among Us characters, and we removed the background using the [Pixlr online tool](https://pixlr.com/remove-background/). We made the character appear to walk by switching costumes using code like this:
```
when @greenFlag clicked
go to x: (0) y: (0)
repeat (10)
    next costume
    move (10) steps
    wait (.2) seconds
end
```
{: .msb}

The student was challenged to explain why the the character was starting in the middle of the screen, and we talked about how to find the x and y coordinates of a character. Change the goto does the trick:

```
go to x: (-275) y: (0)
```

### Recap for April 26th

Back to Scratch
  : Some kids moved back to Scratch after a long time with Tynker. I had loosely offered this a while back, and the kids have asked for it since then. This will allow us to focus more on details and specific steps. 

Virus Shooting
  : Student H continued working on his Virus Shooting Project. Today we worked in the photo editor making his character into a silhouette but cutting part out, and painting over it. Then we moved to coding. We worked on making the gun follow the mouse pointer and limiting the motion to certain directions. This required 2 if block, an a condition block to test tthe diretion and point in the right direction.


```
when @greenFlag clicked
forever
    point towards [mouse-pointer v]
    if <(direction) > [20]> then
        point in direction (20)
    end
    if <(direction) < [-41]> then
        point in direction (-41)
    end
end

when I receive [message2 v]
play sound [Squish Pop v] until done

when @greenFlag clicked
forever
    say (direction)
end

```
{: .msb}

{% include turbowarp.html Name="Virus Shooter" ID="517634593" caption="The spraygun's motion is limited to between -30 and 35 degrees" %}


Tutorials
  : Student M worked in Tynker. As a warmup, he made mouse follow the mousepointer and a cat follow the rat . He made the game stop if the cat caught the mouse. The key was using touching blocks, with forever loops  to do the testing

```
when @greenFlag clicked 
forever
    glide (1) secs to [Mouse1 v]
end

// Cat follows mouse


when @greenFlag clicked 
forever
    go to [mouse-pointer v]
end

// Mouse follows pointer


when @greenFlag clicked 
forever
    if <touching [Cat v]?> then
        say [help] for (2) seconds
        stop [all v]
    end
end

// when touched game stops
```
{: .msb}

{% include turbowarp.html Name="mouse run" ID="521123023" caption="" %}


Pong
  : Then he finished a tutorial for a pong like game. We experimented with different rebound angles for the ball, e.g. 200 degrees instead of 180 degrees.


```
when @greenFlag clicked
forever
    if <touching [Magic Wand v]?> then
        change [score v] by (1)
        turn @turnRight (200) degrees::motion // 200 degrees instead of 180 degrees
        move (15) steps
        wait (0.5) seconds
    end
end
```
{: .msb}


{% include turbowarp.html Name="Pong" ID="521128840" caption="" %}


### Makeup Class
There was also a makeup class.

Joke Game
  : Student A1 finished his comic strip joke class. He added more characters and conversation, as well as a cute "Fin" end card. The project is below but beware, the volume is high, so turn it down before you play the project.

{% include tynkerprojectpage.html Name="Joke" ID="https://www.tynker.com/play/joke/607e7e767499e620f9630a0c-610559XroM3d00DC4i3IC,ulTdk.Yk" %}



Comic 
  : Student A2 was also working on a comic. This time we revised it 

We moved the font and color information to a separate initializion block

![Imgur](https://i.imgur.com/BugB9tz.png){: .jsgif}


We talked about loops. For example, we used a loop to move the caveman towards the karate kid and to change the karate kid's costume while he kicks. We counted the number of costumes so that we would end on a high kick.

![Imgur](https://i.imgur.com/3JC5plC.png){: .jsgif .autoimage}

We also used a broadcast to hide the Karate Kid and the Caveman at the end.

Here is the final product

### Recap for April 19th

#### In-person class

Virus Shooter
  : I worked on a game with student H. We planned out the game, which involves a character shooting spray paint at bad guys. I asked what the overall goal of the game was, and he said there was no real goal but to go around shooting people. However, after a while he came up with an idea involving exterminating a virus. We got to the point where we designed the main character, a villain, and a paintgun. He wanted to do some modifications on a stock character so we learned to use the image editor to flip elements, and group and ungroup elements.

This is a mockup of what part of the project might look like once we are finished:

{% include turbowarp.html Name="Virus Shooter" ID="517893944" %}

Witch and Goblins game
  : I prompted Student M to come up with a story for his project, and to try ot develop more variety in his games. He came up with a new game idea involving a wizard, some goblins trying to capture a village, and boss goblins. The goal is to capture a treasure, and we worked together how to make music play when the treasure is touched. I again suggested developing the story more, such as adding more options and actions in the game, and adding other characters or other possible actions for the wizard. This is something we will continue to work on. 

{% include tynkerprojectpage.html Name="Goblin Die" ID="https://www.tynker.com/play/goblin-die/604b2c86bcbcb33a3a652501-717565XiM.YNyCpQ1Xsg9SMr8cXJMk" %}

### Zoom class

We also had a Zoom class for some students who couldn't attend the in-person class. The students worked on doing the **Comic Strip** tutorial, which students were invited to do and modify.

Student A decided to make the strip a series of jokes. On his own he used message blocks to make the conversation, but the result was somewhat flat. I prompted him to make the page more dynamic, for example including adding animation when they speak, and movements. He began doing that and the result is better, and will continue for homework.

{% include tynkerprojectpage.html Name="Joke (remix)" ID="https://www.tynker.com/play/joke/607e7e767499e620f9630a0c-807272Xlxzv7p5j8nl5uRaBlyGN68k" %}


A second student A had some questions about the text bubbles, such as the set pen size, color, and set font blocks, so we walked through an explanation of what the blocks did and created some examples of various settings. The student also learned about the difference between a **plain say block** and a **say for X seconds** block. Then we added an animation using a next costume loop. 

{% include tynkerprojectpage.html Name="Comic" ID="https://www.tynker.com/play/comic/607e81cc46dc2f545e4ad525-549194Xr6y..w4RWHz5PD.90gMXSwk" %}

## April 12th

Today we had 2 kids attending via Zoom. I gave kids feedback on their projects from last week and made suggestions for further steps. 2 of the kids took me up on this, and 2 started new projects.

Dance Party
  : For the dance party he added face movement when the character was speaking, and keys to press to adjust the background, as well as an instruction screen.


{% include tynker.html Name="Dance Party" ID="607401d9d9a06f67ed14d15b" %}

Three Little Codeys
  : One student was prompted to come up with a story to go with her project. Her story involved 3 little pigs (aka Codeys) who meet 3 bad guys. They are scared when they see the bad guys, so we programmed this into the characters. Then she decided to add a new level, and we tried to copy the actors from the first level using the backpack. For some reason this didn't work, so we  added new characters by using tynker and copied the code using the backpack. Her homework was to finish telling the story.

{% include tynker.html Name="Three Little Codeys" ID="607401cf2cb8fe6f4f607900" %}

Platformer:
  : One child continued working on his platformer project. He got stuck with a character who disappeared and I helped him locate his current coordinates and make a character show who has been invisible.

{% include tynker.html Name="Platformer" ID="6074145b139a1e11855c1bdf" %}

Animated Butterfly
  : We began to work on his game, but he decided he wanted to check out Scratch again. We suggested the idea of poriting  a project from Tynker to Scratch. He chose the among us project, and we talked about how to make animation from individual costumes. He made a simple animation for his project.

### Recap for April 5th

Students were not able to agree on a project to work on together, so they started out on individual projects.

Helicopter Shooting Game
  : The biggest challenge of the day was a student who wanted to make a shooting game, only without using the pre-set shoot and attack blocks. While it is easy to just use the pre-set blocks, when you want to control things carefully, you sometimes have to build it on your own. We worked out together on the whiteboard the exact steps that shooting a bullet would involve:

1. Triggering the action (when pressed)
2. Appearing in the right place (go to and show)
3. Moving to the next place (glide)
4. Detecting contact (touching?)
5. Reacting to the content (send and receive message)

We then converted this into basic blocks. We created the bullet and then a new costume to show the enemy had been shot. Here is sample code (with errors to be fixed):

![Imgur](https://i.imgur.com/rAztuI7.png){: .jsgif}

![Imgur](https://i.imgur.com/m2HRTMb.png){: .jsgif .autoimage}

After a false start involving clones, we simplified to one helicopter at first. When we got it working, we had one very excited student! The next step would be to add more helicopters.


{% include tynker.html Name="Helicopter Shooting Game" ID="606aca1653b07445784897a0" %}

Pet Simulator
  : This student decided she wanted to redo the pet simulator project. This was great, cause we realized she didn't quite understand where the location of the costumes was, and how to test when two characters are touching. Once she understood this, she was able to add the cupcake on her own. Apparently, the face doesn't like cupcakes.

![Imgur](https://i.imgur.com/wfJMbRu.png){: .jsgif} 

{% include tynker.html Name="Pet Simulator" ID="606ad4aeec926e63ac1d4c0a" %}

Platformer Game
  : She then decided to try her hand at a platformer game. This went swimmingly until she realized she wanted to delete the horde of bad guys she had put there first. Unfortunately in Tynker you have to laboriously delete each character. Now it is much more manageable.

{% include tynker.html Name="Platformer Game" ID="606add3c15183a5a9c6c29ea" %}

Dance Party
  : Another student decided to work on a dance party. This is pretty straightforward, and a work in progress.

### Recap for March 29th

Today was an interesting class. The kids spontaneously decided to hold an impromptu coding contest after seeing one student's project. We all started out with the same basic project.

{% include tynker.html Name="Student Challenge for March 29th" ID="60618e1a410546550141113c" %}

The challenge was to do something to modify the project to make it better. Students worked individually and we ended up with three different projects. We then scored the projects according to different criteria 

    1. Creativity
    2. Originality
    3. Hard Work
    4. Visual Effects
    5. Easy to use and understand
    6. Music

and kids talked about which criteria each project did best on. Here are their projects.

### Recap for March 22nd

Fun Meanie Project  
  : One student, as in the project we reviewed in the February 22nd class, wanted a door that would open when the actor collected a coin. This time, instead of a coin, he wanted to make it a person. 

The meanies are in a trap, but we want to open the trap when the actor collects the collectable. We use **the set tile at point** block to initialize the stage at start, and then we send a message when the collectable is collected to set the tiles to empty when the character is collected. 


![Imgur](https://i.imgur.com/FqAXFaB.jpg){: .jsgif}

{% include tynker.html Name="Fun Meanie Project" ID="603a374854eef562025fc725" %}

Road Crossing
  : This student modified the Chicken Crossing game to make it a Road Crossing game. I challenged her to make the game more different/interesting by adding a third road. This allowed me to show her how to add levels and use the Tynker backpack to move code from one level or project to another.


{% include tynker.html Name="Road Crossing" ID="604f2cfef14fce64b42e9f7b" %}

Gangnam Style
  : Another student was able to finish his project, which involved making a character dance in Gangnam Style. sing animate blocks. He planned out the motions on paper and by looking at the available animations. The class enjoyed an impromptu dance session and learning what Gangnam meant from a student of Korean descent.

{% include tynker.html Name="Gangnam Style" ID="605861d9094f013b6b6674aa" %}

Working at home
  : Another student demonstrated projects he had finished at home recently. He really has been able to learn a lot just by exploring on his own, and was delighted to share his discoveries with me and the other students. One important discovery for him was that you can copy all the code from one actor, like a stock actor, to your own actor to make them behave the same. He had a lot of fun switching characters to give them unexpected behavior.


&#127775; 1. Zonbi
  : The first project was inspired by another student's Zombie game. The Zombie is a modified stock villain. I showed him how to add levels and use the backpack. He then added a top down maze level.

{% include tynker.html Name="Zonbi" ID="604c254053b3cd09ca20c000" %}


&#127775; 2. Torening
  : The student was very proud of his modified stock actors as well as various tile types in this project.

{% include tynker.html Name="Torening" ID="604c39466920982ccb33dde7" %}

&#127775; 3. Rush
  : This project involves multiple heros and using "a" to attack.

### Homework due March 22nd

Individually assigned.

### Recap for March 15th

Today was quiz day. I made a general quiz that involved making a **Me Super ninja Jump Heart Ninja Dinosaur Volcano** (they chose the name) project together.

Kids took turn answering questions. Questions were easy or hard, depending on the individual level. In addition to reviewing simple concepts like hiding, the questions were aimed at making them think, or leading them towards new concepts, such as shortcuts for adding backgrounds and using **point in direction** blocks.

![Imgur](https://i.imgur.com/sLGS2uC.png){: .jsgif}

The final challenge was to make the Ninja jump over a tree. Because this game didn't have the platformer module installed, they had to figure out how to make the character jump directly, which was new for some kids used to **jump** blocks. 


It was fun to see the kids get very excited when they suddenly had an insight or figured out the answer. We will probably revisit this project soon but here it is in its unfinished state. Press right arrow or up arrow to move, and "j" to jump over the tree.

### Recap for March 8th

Today kids worked on their own projects. 

Platformer Game: Making a Bad Guy React to an Approaching Good Guy
  : Platformers are still popular, but kids are now starting to want to customize their games more. 

{% include tynker.html Name="Making a Bad Guy React to an Approaching Good GuyME" ID="603cb6e0a3e768462a1caa4f" %}

One question that came up for several students was how to make the bad guy react when the good guy is near. For example, the bad guy could tell him about the presence of awards and bad guys, or could make clones of himself, or give a riddle to be solved. 

![Imgur](https://i.imgur.com/bV3fU0Y.png){: .jsgif}
  : * A **when [] occurs** holding a  **distance to []** block can detect the good guy, and then we can code our reaction.

{% include tynker.html Name="Making a Bad Guy React to an Approaching Good Guy" ID="603a374854eef562025fc725" %}

Brickbreaker
  : Another student worked hard on a classic brickbreaker game. The tutorial she was working off of was rather fast and hard to follow, so we walked through it together. It involved the very difficult concept of nested loops. We also reviewed static and active blocks, and true versus false.

{% include tynker.html Name="The brickbreaker game is a classic game!" ID="6046e39fa763df276940ef2c" %}

![Imgur](https://i.imgur.com/2jQj6wh.png){: .jsgif}
  : * **This loop** draws the bricks. It draws all the columns in one row and then the next. Getting the numbers right is tricky.


![the paddle is active](https://i.imgur.com/mkTMsa0.png){: .jsgif}
  : * **The Paddle is Active and Static** Active means it can feel hits. Static means it doesn't move if it is hit. It doesn't receive "kicks".

![the ball is active, but not static](https://i.imgur.com/HN1QJvb.png){: .jsgif }
  : * **The Ball** can move, and it can receive "kicks" (impulses). Restitution means that it keeps all its energy when it bounces. An friction means it doesn't stick to the paddle.


Doodle Jump
  : Another tutorial was not that difficult but had outdated code in it for making a scoreboard, and I had to create an up-to-date version. Luckily, the newer method is much simpler. Note the nice scoreboard in the final project.

### Recap for March 1st

Project Preview: Among Us
  : Today I looked at platform games, and how to give a character "lives". 
  
Last week a student asked how to make a character come to life again. There are several ways, and this week I showed how to do it using the **set** and **properties** blocks. 

![set lives](https://i.imgur.com/5VETctG.png){: .jsgif}

![properties](https://i.imgur.com/1UQsWMO.png)

We walked through a [tutorial](https://www.tynker.com/play/za-tutorial/60342b84e25d447d91562ac6-556329XkLKUhN7.xk1aXOsgIZT3cEk) that explains it in detail. The homework is to work through the tutorial again on your own, and try to add something new. Here is what it should look like in the end (press s to shoot, and right arrow to move closer). As you can see, the zombie comes back!!

{% include tynker.html Name="Among Us" ID="603420aac319be37a801ac98" %}

### Homework due March 1st

Work on your ongoing personal project.


### Recap for February 22nd

Platform with balloons
  : Today we reviewed the "Platform with balloons" project (based on a student project) and I reviewed with the entire class how to set tiles inside Tynker to make a trap for meanies. 
  
The meanies are in a trap, but we want to open the trap when the actor collects the ring. We use **the set tile at point** block. We initialize it closed at start, and then we change the tiles to empty when the character is collected. 

![Imgur](https://i.imgur.com/FqAXFaB.jpg){: .jsgif}

As a modification, kids each chose a different kind of tile, and you can see the result of the code here.

![Imgur](https://i.imgur.com/9ftRGMY.png){: .jsgif}

I then showed how to add a character that speaks when another character approaches. Using and **if** block, we check to see if the distance to the main actor is less than 300 pixels. If so, the character says the message. If he is beyond 300 pixels, we say nothing.

![Imgur](https://i.imgur.com/Bg2q27K.jpg){: .jsgif}

In this case the actor tells the main actor that he has to collect a ring before he can attack the green meanies. Here it is everything in live game action.

![Attack green meanies](https://i.imgur.com/YrKpOB2.gif){: .jsgif}

How to make a character come to life again
  : A student had an interesting question about how to make a character come to life again. Next week we will talk about two ways to do this, but here is a preview:

{% include tynker.html Name="come to life again" ID="603420aac319be37a801ac98" %}

Debugging Tic Tac Toe 
  : Kids then worked on their ongoing projects. The biggest challenge today was in teh Tic Tac Toe game. This required some debugging by the student, and the student was able to figure it out by themselves once I gave a hint as to where the problem code was. Great Job!!

### Recap for February 15th

#### Preliminary Activity

We started off with an activity aimed at prompting some positivity and team spirit. Kids went around the room and tried to say one nice thing about one other person. Even though some kids struggled with this, I think it was helpful at getting them to think in those terms. Based on this I talked the positive qualities the kids in this class have. Then I talked about how these qualities can be part of becoming a good coder. I wanted them also to think of themselves as coders.

Qualities that kids in this class have that are also good for coders
  : * Creativity 
  : * Energy and Excitement
  : * Getting in ideas from many places.
  : * Cleverness 
  : * Assiduousness 
  : * Learning independently.
  : * Thoughtfulness
  : * Kindness
  : * Willingness to ask questions and search for answers
  : * Concentration
  : * Working through difficulties
  : * Focus


#### Project Review of the Day (February 15th)

Today we also started a project review series. At the beginning of each class we will spend some time reviewing a project that someone has made. As a class, we will then modify it to see how it works, and how to make it better.

Today's project was the Space Rush game.

{% include tynker.html Name="Space Rush" ID="6021522f326cdc17cf2e10d4" %}

We looked at the code that controls how the Ship moves and adjust ed the the parameters to make the character move faser and more smoothly.

By making how far the ship moves each time larger, the ship moves faster, but less smoothly. By decreasing the wait the ship goes faster:

Kids really enjoyed being able to modify the code to see what would happen, especially using "crazy" umbers like zero or 1000000. 

#### Motivation System

To help with motivation in the class I started an bonus points system where kids collect points for positive contributions such as cooperation, teamwork, and concentration and hard work. Ultimately the goal is to add a little fun and a rewards for their had work; given that they are still gaining skills and making mistakes and getting stuck from time to time, the intrinsic rewards of making something work are not as strong.

#### Platformers are popular

This week there was a sudden surge in interest in Platform games. One girl had come up with her own since last week, and another two kids decided to copy her effort!!

### Recap for February 8th

Debugging
  : Today students worked on debugging projects they were working on. 
  
* a Maze project was finished after fixing an error due to a missing minus sign. The student was able to code the 3rd part of the maze all by themselves.
* In order to rename some functions in their code, a student had to reverse engineered the original function to find a suitable rename for it.
* One student is working on an especially creative platform game. They created a Monster Museum and a special monster "cage" that opens when the character collects a certain coin. There was a bug where the tiles that make the door of the cage disappeared when the project was run. We reused a trick from last week to redraw the tiles when the program starts. We also talked about the goal of their project, and make a bunch of balloons appear when the hero collects the final star, which you can see at the end of this sample play.

* Another student had a problem with the Space Rush Game. One of the asteroids wouldn't disappear, and there was not score. We started to discuss why this was happening and next week we will fix it. 
* We worked on a Walk in the Park Game but Tynker's project template was set up for a tablet, so we had to figure out how to modify some of the code so it would work on a pc. Instead of changing the x-tilt:

we had to change the x-position.

### Recap for February 1st

Space Rush
  : One student wanted to take aa project and change the main character. We had already discussed importing actors, and today we talked about how to make animations with characters. There was also a problem with the "teleport" effect (when the actor leaves the screen at one side and comes back on the other side.) This requires testing for when the actor leaves one edge, and then sending them to opposite edge.

{% include tynker.html Name="Space Rush" ID="600e8c3d4359961a9571f83a" %}

Among Us
  : The student was very ambitious. They worked on planning the next stage of their an Among Us game. Watching another student, they were also inspired to start their own Platform game. 

Initializing Tiles
  : In a platform game this student was working on, certain tiles disappear if you captured a certain token. We noticed this week that if you restart the game the tokens remain disappeared. To fix this we had to make sure the tokens are drawn when we start. In the initialization below, one of the tiles has been changed to show which tiles were being changed.

Maze
  : One student made a maze based on a tutorial. Some special modifications included:
  
  : * vary the speed of the motion by changing a wait block.
  : * initialize the size of the actor at the start

  : In the example below, click the mouse to move the tiny fish.

Watch it here:

{% include tynker.html Name="Maze" ID="6017cb9e365a4a4c562b881a" %}


Tic Tac Toe
  : The Tic Tac Toe project continues. 
  
  : The current task is changing the code to use ```switch to  background () :: looks```{: .msb}  instead of ```hide :: looks```{: .msb} for the squares. 
  
  : We decided that to change the code simultaneously on all the squares it is better to make one actor the way we want and duplicate the actor.  
  
  : On the way there, I suggested to the student that it is very helpful to give meaningful names to messages. The student worked on renaming all their messages to more meaningful ones. This involved a bit of debugging to figure out just what each message was doing. This was a very good exercise in analyzing code. 

  In the end, there is still one little piece that isn't working, and they still have to copy all the actors, but all in all they did very good work.

### Recap for January 25th 

Platformer Game
  : Student finished shooting game and the other students had a lot of fun playing the game. It was very challenging, and everyone had fun trying to beat the game. The student really enjoyed explaining all the special features of the game.

{% include tynker.html Name="Platformer Game" ID="5ff2d7d79b253560ca4078b5" %}

Pet Project and Art Studio
  : The student finished up the last part of their Pet Project. We looked at some other projects together and found one she would like. For this Art Studio we worked through sending and receiving a message to change the costume of the pen actor when the colored squares are clicked. The student added some actors and tried to recreate the code, and we focused on making sure the new names and references were right. 

{% include tynker.html Name="Art Studio" ID="6005537ab7669807061233e8" %}

Tic Tac Toe
  : The student made a lot of progress on this project today. First we had a problem locating the position of the actors. Due to a quirk in Tynker, hidden AND blank characters are not visible or clickable even when not running the program, so you need to make the character visible by changing costume. In the code, therefore, instead of showing and hiding the characters, we changed the costumes to blank instead. 
  : Having done that, we then placed the actors in the right position and renamed them.
  : Then, we started making the code that would allow us to click the square to make it X or O. 
  : The student quickly understood that we need a variable "who the player is".
  : After creating that variable, we initialized it and created the if else loop that tests to see who the player is before changing the costume.
  : All in all a lot of great work for one day!


First Project
  : A student working on their first Tynker project. They learned how to import costumes into Tynker but had a problem uploading the actor's costume. We learned that you must make sure you download as jpg/png and not as html.


Haunted House/Among Us
  : I revised the Haunted House project a bit so that it would be faster, and the student was quite pleased. However, they had started on another project and were having a problem making the character disappear. It turned out the code was correct, but they had typed the name of the actor into the space and probably had a typo or extra space. We learned that it is usually better to click from the drop down menu if one is offered.

Keep working on projects. 

### Recap for January 18th


Tutorials, First Project
  : Some students worked mostly on tutorials. One student started his first project. The first thing he wanted to do was import some pictures of his favoriete character to use as actor, so I showed him how to do this. 

Hugh
  : I showed one student the proof-of-concept Haunted House Project from last week's notes. After thinking about it, he gave me some ideas for what he wants to do, and I am going to simplify the project a bit so that he can continue it. In the meantime he came up with some specific ideas for a Top-Down game and began planning and coding it.

Tic Tac Toe
  : The tic tac toe project is coming along very well. The student has on their own created using costumes and message various screens.

  : The project has an opening screen, a character selection and rules selection screen, and a rules screen, as well as the main board. In addition, actors to represent the 9 position on the board are being created. We worked together on solving a problem with the logic for returning to the actor selection screen, and talked about what the position actors would look like. I showed him a demonstration project that gave him an idea of how players cod take turns. This project is full of opportunities for learning.

```
when actor clicked :: events
switch to background (blank1) :: looks
send message [show] to [actor] with []:: events
send message [show] to [actor2] with [] ::events
hide :: looks
broadcast (hide rules) :: events
```
{: .msb}

Here is an incomplete version:

Peep project, and Pet simulator
  : The Peep Nature Walk project turned out to be more difficult than expected. The student made a good effort and learned some things. Here is what it could have looked like:

{% include tynker.html Name="Peep project" ID="6005f50a2e6d82407f707508" %}

Pet Simulator
  : Since it was difficult I gave her the option of trying a new project and she chose the Pet Simulator. This project uses the following series of if statements to choose a different reaction for the pet for each food. 

![pet simulator](https://i.imgur.com/CCwp0qc.png){: .jsgif}

Shooting Game: 
  Another student had a an interesting goal. He wanted to make certain tiles disappear after the player captured a special ring. This is actually quite easy, though it sound difficult to do. The key block is this one:

```
set tile at x: () y: () to (empty) :: looks
```
{: .msb}

After showing the student how to figure out what x and y should be, he was able to complete it himself and continue working on his game.

### Homework due January 18th

Individually Assigned.

### Recap for January 11th

Tic Tac Toe
  : A students is working on a tic tac toe game. We talked about how it should be set up, and the student worked on making an introduction and rules. His homework is to create actors for each of the positions and give each 3 costumes (blank, X, O).

Tutorials
  : One child continues to work on tutorials and needed a little help with understanding if conditionals.

Haunted House
  : The Haunted House project hit a few snags as at first, characters kept "falling" when the program started. Sometimes students, especially creative ones, have problems or questions that are difficult to answer, not because there isn't an answer, but the answer or explanation is long, difficult, uncertain, and so on. This is an example. The answer turns out to depend on the following, among other things:  
  
  : * The "static" and "active" settings. 
  : * The main fact that character in a platform game will fall until he/she hits the either a platform of the bottom of the world. 
  : * The fact that in this case you need to use an invisible platform, and invisible platforms are not available in the basic GUI. You CAN use them, but you have to program them.
  : * You also need to set the world size to an appropriate value, and this depends on the size of the stage and whether the stage is normal, stretched, or tiled.
  : * Lastly, the fact that Tynker's documentation of these is confusing and sparse. 

The following project shows how it works. When it starts, it creates a visible platform. If you press c, it replaces the visible platform with an invisible one that the player can walk on:

{% include tynker.html Name="Haunted House" ID="5ffc1a203ab9a77e703c2363" %}

Platform Game
  : Another student continued to make a complex platform game with various platforms, enemies, and even a dead-end trap. While it is easy and fun to just add new characters to shoot at, I suggested making the game more interesting by adding a story to it, such as a goal or endpoint, or an object to collect. Perhaps next week.


Peep and the Big Wide World
  : Another student kept working on her walk through the forest project. She added a butterfly that followed peep, and then created a conversation between Peep and the butterfly. Her homework is to create other scenarios.

### Homework due January 11th

Keep working on Tutorials and Projects.

### Recap for January 4th


Haunted House
  : One limitation of Tynker is that it only allows one to work in 2-D. One student and I had a long talk about how create a more 3-D effect, is in a POV game. This was  a great conversation as it really helps to understand what can and can't be done, and how to use what you can do in creative ways. For example, to do this in Tynker, you would need to create a separate costume for each position and orientation of your character. Tynker has a tiling feature that allows characters to move smoothly in a plane, but not "in or out" of the plane. However, if you imagine that this flat plane is curved around in a circle, you can create a kind of panorama effect. When the character moves it appears are if they are turning around. Using the panorama app on your camera you can instantly create panorama. The hard part is **drawing** panoramas. This was a great question even though the answer, ultimately, was no,, you can't create that type of game in Tynker. 

Tutorials
  : One student worked through some tutorials, including a challenging one about navigating a maze.  She chose her next project, which is based on a project from [Peep and the Big Wide World](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCPq6g4Q4-SFMIJ048IXmupA). 
  
{% include tynker.html Name="Peep" ID="5ff176f0657ea54613390f5b" %}
  
By the way:
  : Peep and the Big Wide World is a great show for kids and I heartily recommend it.

New Student
  : We welcomed a new student. After some quick setup, the student started in on the beginner tutorial, which they mostly worked through on their own. They also spent some time getting to know (aka goofing around with) their benchmate, and the other kids in the class. 

Platform Game
  : One student continued working on his platform game. After a bit of encouragement to give his game more of a story, he imagined that in his story, the hero battles a few villains, and finally falls to the ground. On the ground, there is a sign telling him the big boss is "this way". He spent some time with the image editor creating this sign. Where will it go from here? Stay tuned.

Another student turned this into a conversation, where one character says "You will die", and the other says "Not if I kill you first!". Using messages, we can make this happen.

### Bridgit

I ended up the class by teaching them a new pen and pencil game called [Gale or Bridgit](http://www.papg.com/show?1TPI). Drawing the game itself is a bit of a challenge, and the game involves strategy and logical reasoning, all good skills for coding.
