## January 11th

### Homework due January 18th

Individually Assigned.

### Recap for January 11th

Tic Tac Toe
  : A students is working on a tic tac toe game. We talked about how it should be set up, and the student worked on making an introduction and rules. His homework is to create actors for each of the positions and give each 3 costumes (blank, X, O).

Tutorials
  : One child continues to work on tutorials and needed a little help with understanding if conditionals.

Haunted House
  : The Haunted House project hit a few snags as at first, characters kept "falling" when the program started. Sometimes students, especially creative ones, have problems or questions that are difficult to answer, not because there isn't an answer, but the answer or explanation is long, difficult, uncertain, and so on. This is an example. The answer turns out to depend on the following, among other things:  
  
  : * "Static" and "active" settings. 
  : * The main fact that character in a platform game will fall until he/she hits the either a platform of the bottom of the world. 
  : * The fact that in this case you need to use an invisible platform, and invisible platforms are not available in the basic GUI. You CAN use them, but you have to program them.
  : * You also need to set the world size to an appropriate value, and this depends on the size of the stage and whether the stage is normal, stretched, or tiled.
  : * Lastly, the fact that Tynker's documentation of these is confusing and sparse. 

The following project shows how it works. When it starts, it creates a visible platform. If you press c, it replaces the visible platform with an invisible one that the player can walk on:

Platform Game
  : Another student continued to make a complex platform game with various platforms, enemies, and even a dead-end trap. While it is easy and fun to just add new characters to shoot at, I suggested making the game more interesting by adding a story to it, such as a goal or endpoint, or an object to collect. Perhaps next week.


Peep and the Big Wide World
  : Another student kept working on her walk through the forest project. She added a butterfly that followed peep, and then created a conversation between Peep and the butterfly. Her homework is to create other scenarios.
