### Recap for December 14th

This class students worked individually on their projects. As it turns out, everyone is working on different things:

A Family Story
    : One student work on using pixlr to prepare characters. She cleaned up an image to remove the background using the magic wand and rectangle tools. 
    
    : Then she worked on creating a conversation between characters.

Magic The Gathering
    : One students did a tutorial about functions, and studied an MTG game that uses functions to see if it could be a good project for them.

Pong Game
    : This student remixed a Pong game and discovered a bug: The game didn't stop even when the player lost. 
    
    : We then went over the code to see if we could fix it. We did!! 
    
Platform Game
    : One student is designing a Platform Game. He discovered  on his own an undocumented feature where you can shoot larger bullets by holding the key down. 
    
    : The student then worked on improving the placement of their actors.
