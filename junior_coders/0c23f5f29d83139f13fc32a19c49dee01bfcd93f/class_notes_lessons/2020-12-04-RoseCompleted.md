## December 4th

### Homework due December 11th

The homework is keep revising your projects. What happens when you press a key? What happens when you click a character? Can you use random numbers to make it interesting?


### Recap for December 4th


Today kids worked mostly on their own projects. 

1. **Animating a story with key presses**

The when key pressed block makes something happen when a key is pressed.

When the right arrow key is pressed, the character moves right.

We used this to make the character do different animations (dance, attack, fall down) when the key was pressed. This allowed the character to act out a story by pressing different keys. 

2. **When actor clicked**

Another way to make things happen is when the actor is clicked. In this project, clicking the 2nd robot makes him jump up. For next week, make him come down, and make the other actors move as well.

3. **Funny Circles**

Continuing on the idea of drawing circles, one student played with changing the pen color and pen size using random values. This created some cool effects.
