### Recap for January 25th 

Platformer Game
  : Student finished shooting game and the other students had a lot of fun playing the game. It was very challenging, and everyone had fun trying to beat the game. The student really enjoyed explaining all the special features of the game.

Pet Project and Art Studio
  : The student finished up the last part of their Pet Project. We looked at some other projects together and found one she would like. For this Art Studio we worked through sending and receiving a message to change the costume of the pen actor when the colored squares are clicked. The student added some actors and tried to recreate the code, and we focused on making sure the new names and references were right.

Tic Tac Toe
  : The student made a lot of progress on this project today. First we had a problem locating the position of the actors. Due to a quirk in Tynker, hidden AND blank characters are not visible or clickable even when not running the program, so you need to make the character visible by changing costume. In the code, therefore, instead of showing and hiding the characters, we changed the costumes to blank instead. 
  : Having done that, we then placed the actors in the right position and renamed them.
  : Then, we started making the code that would allow us to click the square to make it X or O. 
  : The student quickly understood that we need a variable "who the player is".
  : After creating that variable, we initialized it and created the if else loop that tests to see who the player is before changing the costume.
  : All in all a lot of great work for one day!


First Project
  : A student working on their first Tynker project, Space Rush. They decided they wanted to change the rocket to an "Among Us" character and we talked about how to import costumes into Tynker but had a problem uploading the actor's costume. We learned that you must make sure you download as jpg/png and not as html.


Haunted House/Among Us
  : I revised the Haunted House project a bit so that it would be faster, and the student was quite pleased. However, they had started on another project and were having a problem making the character disappear. It turned out the code was correct, but they had typed the name of the actor into the space and probably had a typo or extra space. We learned that it is usually better to click from the drop down menu if one is offered.
