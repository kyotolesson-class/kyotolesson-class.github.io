It still has some bugs here and there, such as there is no way to unassign a project. However The coding interface is more user friendly that Scratch. The community features are not as nicely set up. However they have a tutorial maker that makes it easy to prepare guided lessons more easily that Scratch. Also, I can monitor student progress, and answer questions in real time, in fact at any time, not just in class 





There is a lot of advertising. They are trying to sell you something especially in the later stages. However, you can do a lot without purchasing, and I don't plan at this point in using any of the paid features. We are not at that stage of coding yet. 

## Difference between:

move: instantly puts the character that many steps in teh direction it is pointing
glide: walks there instead

draw: draws on teh background
say: uses a bubble
label: puts in on the character centered
print: ???

set angle: direction of motion
rotate: changes the rotation of the actor

angle: goes from 0 to 360. up = 90 down = 270
direction: goes from -180 to +180 up= 0 down = 180
