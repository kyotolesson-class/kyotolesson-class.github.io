### Recap for June 6th

Today there were just two students. 

Ghost Balloon Crossing
  : Student R Continued making his ghost balloon crossing game. He made each ball produce a different effect when it touched the ghost. 

* purple rotate once
* pink: push
* green: enlarge
* yellow: rotate many times
* blue: send to beginning

He also added a score variable and made the background switch to a new level when the score reached 50.

There were some coding errors in his version that we will fix next week. Here is a corrected version:

Dragon and Castle
  : Student H worked on porting his ScratchJr. **Dragon and Castle** project to Scratch. He was able to make the rocket move up if the right character was pressed, and to make the rocket turn left smoothly. His homework is to continue the path of the rocket.


```
when I receive [fire rocket v]
point in direction (0) 
repeat (10) // moves 100 steps up
    move (10) steps
end
repeat (10) /// turn left 90 degrees
    turn @turnLeft (9) degrees::motion
end

when @greenFlag clicked
point in direction (0) //rocket has been adjusted to point up in direction 0
switch costume to [rocketship-a2 v] // adjusted costume
go to x: (166) y: (4)
```

### Recap for June 5th

Swordfighting
  : Student Y continued updating his swordfighting project. After the fighters move to the side of the screen, the first two fighters approach each other to fight. We added a broadcast message block to start the sequence.

The next question is how to get the players to alternate kicks. The answer was to use a wait and an animate/wait on one character,

but a animate/wait and *then* a wait on the other.

Fairy Treasure Game
  : I suggested Student R add a storyline to her fairy chase game. She added an opening level to her game where the robot steals the fairy's treasure.

Mermaid
  : Student A continued adding code to move the candies to the baskets.

Making Rain
  : Student K started on the making rain project. He was able to make the rain fall fairly easily. I challenged him to add an introductory part and turn it into more of a story.


Maze 
  : Students Y and R continued working on ScratchJr projects.
