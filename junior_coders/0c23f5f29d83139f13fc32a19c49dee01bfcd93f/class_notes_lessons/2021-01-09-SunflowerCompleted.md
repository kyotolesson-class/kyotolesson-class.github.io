## January 9th

### Homework due January 16th

Play and explore the program as much as you can on your own but bring back a project to share with the group. 

### Recap for January 9th

Today was the first class. We walked through the Scratch Jr. Once we were at the main interface,

we covered: 

- The top row of buttons.
- The yellow start/green flag button
- The blue motion buttons


I gave the kids some challenges:

- Make the cat go to all four corners?
- How many times does the cat go around if he takes 99 steps?
- How many steps does he need to take to go once around side-to-side?
- How many steps does he need to take to go once around up and down?
- How many turn steps does it take to go around 1 time? 


Then we talked about drawing backgrounds and how to use the drawing program. We covered all the different buttons, and then kids spent some time playing with it. As usual, using the camera was a big favorite. 

Then they were asked to make a simple two-line maze ([see the Overview](../../Overview/JuniorCodersOverview.html) for a sample). When they were done, we shared the results. Fortuitously, one kid discovered a maze that could go on forever.
