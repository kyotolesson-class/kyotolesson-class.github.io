### Review Project: "Pass It On"



### June 29th Homework

* **Solve the Space Ship Problem** (in screens 3 and 4). [Here is a guide for you to download](./scratchProjects/20200706SpaceShipProblemHW.sjr). It has 4 screens:
1. **Diagonal Movement** from class, and a simpler one without loops.
2. **The Red Shrinking Cat** that didn't work. (has loops)
3. Fix this **Red Cat** to make it not bump. Click the box for a hint.
4. An example of how to change direction. Can you make the pig do it too?

* **Extra Credit**: Do you see how I made the hint appear and disappear? Can you copy that somewhere?
* **Extra Credit**: Watch the Aliens have landed video (above) and try to make it (without having the source code). What would you give (of yours!) to an alien?
