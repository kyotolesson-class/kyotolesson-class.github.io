Individual Homeworks. Keep working on projects.
### Recap for November 30th

Today most of the kids chose to start new projects. First kids worked on planning new projects, and we had a variety of types. We had a (not-so-simple) simple story, a shooting game, a platform game, and some character design play.##

#### Group Photo Shoot 

The highlight of the class was a group photo shoot. As a team we all got together and took pictures of a lego boy which one student wanted to use as a character.
