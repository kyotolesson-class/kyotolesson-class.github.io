## July 10th

### Review the Under the Sea

We reviewed the homework projects.

### Initializiing a character

To set the initial position, visibility, or size of a character:

* **manually** change the position of the character.

Note in the gif above, if I use a block to change the position, it returns when I press the return button. If I manually move it, it stays.

* **manually** change the visibility

* **manually** change the size

This is useful if you want a character to start off small, or in a certain position. 

* Rotation **doesn't work**

### Repeats 

#### Repeat the Repeat

I briefly discussed repeats within repeats:

1. Put some actions in a repeat block.
2. Add something to that, and put that in a repeat block
3. Repeat step 2

Not so interesting at this point.


### Drawing Backgrounds and characters

We reviewed the Drawing Editor to:

* Create circles, squares, and lines 
* Use different thicknesses
* Fill in drawings
* Move drawings
* Change the shape of blocks
* Delete drawings

### Face Spinner

To practice using the editor, the kids reverse engineered the project above, but then, for fun, we put each other's pictures in the circles to make cool **Face Spinner**. 

Then they made the spinner spin. As a challenge, I proposed making the spinner go fast at first and slower later. Most kids did it this way:

### July 10th Hangman

At the end we had a little time left and we played Hangman. For some kids it was their first time playing this children's classic spelling game!

### July 10 Homework: "Outer Space"

The homework is to try to make this project just from watching the video. The stars and sun are just like we did in class. The Green Cat is a little different and you might have to think about it. The Astronaut is a new trick we will learn next time!
