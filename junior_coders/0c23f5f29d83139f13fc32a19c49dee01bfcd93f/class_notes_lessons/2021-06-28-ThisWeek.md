### Recap for June 28th

Chase Games
  : Two students independently completed the chase game tutorial. They added sound when a point is scored, and displayed the score. Everyone had a lot of fun playing the completed game.

Flapping Dove
  : Student A was very proud that she could make the dove in this project flap it's wings (when the left and rigt arrow are pressed.

Falling Bird Attempt
  : Student H was very excited to emulate a falling bird type project, and we started to code it by copying some code using the Backpack.

Slashnight remod
  : He made one small correction to his attempted remod of Slashknight.

The arrow is just there to help him find the coordinates he needs. " %}


Growing Tynker Platform Collection
  : Student M really likes Tynker platfrom type games, and he was very excited to show me that, independently, he had added another to his collection.

Congratualtions and Farewells
  : Lastly but not leastly, student A made this congratulatory Scratch Card.

At the end of the class we held a small farewell for him, and played as a group a new scratch game called Headlight. 

{% include zakviewer.html Name="Hatlight" ID="https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/122190314/" caption="Use the Left and Right arrow keys to move. Use the Up, Spacebar or Z key to jump! Find batteries to power your Hatlight!" %}

### Recap for June 25th


The Final Battle
  : Student Y is doing well using sequential messaging to structure the action in his Sword Fight project, adding the final battle to his Sword Fight project, and also some dramatic music. He has worked very hard on this project, and I think learned a lot from it.

{% include tynkerprojectpage.html Name="Sword Fight Final Battle" ID="https://www.tynker.com/play/sword-fight-6-25/60d8db806ae5ef1432533cda-873665XnwD4pJ1z,h5nfKMSM1HG1ok" caption="" %}

Crossy Road
  : This week, Student C decided to start a new project called Crossy Road, but it is still in the early stages. She may return to her previous project later.

How Levels Work
  : Student A had some more questions about how levels work, especially in our code. I explained that the code does this: Whenever a candy is touched, it broadcasts a message to every character. It says, if I am not the character who was touched, keep moving back until I am at layer 93. If I am the character who was touched, go to level 95." This way the last character touched is always in front of the basket. This explanation really helped her. She started adding this code to the characters and modifying the messages to suit each candy. She also added sound to the project.

### Recap for June 26th


Music Box
  :  Student M made all his music covers clickable. We simplified his idea so that every character disappears. This means we can use the same code for every character. When clicked, they each disappear and a large background for that song will appear. 

{% include zakviewer.html Name="" ID="https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/543633250/" caption="The first four appear to be working." %}

Pong and Jumping
  ; Student N added a second level to his pong game, where the color of the apple changes. He plans to make the second level more difficult. 

He also created a jumping project. By using touching color, he makes the sprite fall into the white hole. 


```
when @greenFlag clicked
forever // if it is not touching the ground, fall
    if <not <touching color [#663b00]?>> then
        wait (.01) seconds
        change y by (-10)
    end // when low enough , return home
    if <(y position) = [-227]> then
        go to x: (-175) y: (-104)
    end // if too far right, return home
    if <(x position) > [243]> then
        go to x: (-175) y: (-104)
        broadcast [message1 v]
    end
end
```

Various Projects 
Student Y started various projects today:

...a video motion detection project

...A flying cat tutorial. 

{% include zakviewer.html Name="" ID="https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/548441244/" caption="I  am not sure what the heart is doing...." %}

and this

Car Project
  : Student H explored making various projects scratch and scratchjr, including a sports car. He explored recording various sound effects to make the car sound (not audible below). The project is still unfinished.

{% include giphy.html link="https://media.giphy.com/media/m9UB6b6p6X7nT5A6rz/" %} 


Goalie
  : Today Student R worked on making his goalie be able to defend the goal. He understood that he had to make the character move from side to side, but needed some help realizing that the character starts from the middle, so the first motion is just halfway. This was more difficult because of what appears to be a bug in Scratch. The following code should work without the first wait, but it doesn't.

  This project is coming along. Next we will have to do some cleaning up, such as what to do when teh ball goes out of bounds, and how to register the score. It also needs better instructions for the user.

```
when backdrop switches to [Soccer v]
wait (1) seconds // this seems unnecessary, but
goto x: (-50) y: (-6) // without it this doesn't happen
repeat (100000)
    wait (1) seconds
    glide (1) secs to x: (100) y: (-6)
    wait (1) seconds
    glide (1) secs to x: (-100) y: (-6)
end
```

Space Invaders
Scratch Jr. Students Y and R worked on a simplified version of Space invaders. This is really an exercise in using messages to have one character control another. The kids seem to understand the concept, but have difficulty knowing exactly where to put the elements. Nonetheless they are good at adding their own creative elements, such as this interesting missile, and are excited about making the project:
