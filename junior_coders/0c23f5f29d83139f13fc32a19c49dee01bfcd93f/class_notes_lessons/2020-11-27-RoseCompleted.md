## November 27th


### Homework due December 4th

Students received individual assignments such as plan out your story, or keep working on adding keypress actions, or keep paying with the spirograph.

### Recap for November 27th

#### Animate and keypress

Starting with last week's move and animate project, we worked on understanding some basic blocks: 

* Making character move with keypress. This included how to use the animate button.

* Using the move by block to move a character around the screen. We worked understanding what the x and y values should be:

For example, to move 300 steps in various directions:

Up
: y=300

Down
: y=300

Left
: x=-300

Right
: x=300

#### An epiphany

Using animate was a lot of fun. For one student, after a bit of experimentation there was a bit of an epiphany: the various actions became a mini story. Another character was added, more fun with the character editor. The challenge for next week will be to put all these actions together in sequence to tell the story. 

#### Problem solving 

A bit of problem solving: The character is facing in wrong direction at first. 

Answer:

#### Drawing a Spirograph

Another student began working on variations of a spirograph. This shows some stages of what we did.

The key blocks are a repeat loop and a turn. We then varied this by changing the color to make a rainbow, and then by adding some random values. We explored varying the values and seeing what happened. For example:
