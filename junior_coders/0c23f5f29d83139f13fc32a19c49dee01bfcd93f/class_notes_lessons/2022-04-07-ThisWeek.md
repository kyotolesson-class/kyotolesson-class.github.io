### Recap for April 1st

Countdown Timer
  : Student K's first task was to create a countdown for the start of the game.

Using Clones to Choose a Weapon
  : Both Students today were at a stage in the game where they could use clones to create a series of buttons for choosing a weapon.

We created clones, and when the clones are clicked, we set a local variable that tells us which weapon to show." %}

### Recap for April 8th

{% include zakviewer.html Name="2022-04-10 Demon Game" ID="https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/614681649/" caption="Student K continue working on his Demon game. He added some more game elements to his main screen, lik HP and hearts. He also began working on making a key press move the weapon to Mikey." %}


{% include imgur.html title="" ID="https://i.imgur.com/7P6sz1j.png" caption="Student M worked on making his cats point in the right direction when they appear. This involved an if test.  We used a set rotation style to keep the cat from rotating upside down, and set the direction to 90 or -90, depending on the variable left or right. The variable left or right is 1 when the character is on the right, and 2 when the character is on the left." width="" height="" spacer="" %}



Scratch Jr New Students
  : New student S1 used ScratchJr. to make a maze. We created a sprite with a set of shapes, and then she taught the cat to move around the shapes. We coded it so that if she touched the shapes, she would return to the original position. At the end we added a target sprite and a special effect when we successfullly reach the end of the maze.

  : New Student S2 started off by exploring Scratchjr. on his own. He told me he likes Pokemon characters, and he played with the paint editor. We made the pokemon characters move around the screen. I taught him how to copy code and he discovered that copying the same motion script made the characters move faster and faster.

He centered all the character costumes to make it easier to control the characters. Then I shared some code with him to use clones to make all the buttons appear. This allowed him to delete useless sprites, and it will be easier to code from now on. " %}

He wanted to glide to random positions at least 200 away from Abu. But we can't tell how far away the random position is until we move there. How to solve this problem?" %}


{% include imgur.html title="" ID="https://i.imgur.com/AQ5Trpm.png" caption="First we made a ball sprite that finds a new random position that is far away from Abu. This sprite is hidden and can move without us seeing it or the Ghost moving. Once it has found a good position, then the ghost can move there." width="" height="" spacer="" %}

{% include imgur.html title="" ID="https://i.imgur.com/tKI6lhn.png" caption="Thus, in the main game loop (ca), the ghost tells the ball go to a random position far away from Abu, then we glide slowly to this position. Since the ball is hidden, it looks like we are gliding to a random position." width="" height="" spacer="" %}

### Recap for April 11th


{% include zakviewer.html Name="2022-04-11 Untitled on Scratch" ID="https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/674342181/" caption="Student T1 was given the challenge to design and completed an original project. On paper she designed the outlines of the project. She signed into her class account and began coding.  " %}


{% include imgur.html title="" ID="https://i.imgur.com/l3cbKud.png" caption="She had to use several concepts today that seemed new or relatively for her. For example, she learned how to use the ask and answer blocks to get user input. She wasn't sure how to take her draft and turn it into an 'if then else' statement, and then I showed her how to create the 'answer = ~' conditional. She as very excited to learn how to duplicate blocks. When we tested her original code, she saw that the 'try again' message only appeared one time. I suggested a 'repeat until block' might help her solve that problem and she quickly realized its potential. I showed her a trick so that the first time the message says 'Type in my code' but if needed the loop repeats with a 'Try again' message until the right answer is provided. Next week she plans to make a parachute game with another student." width="" height="" spacer="" %}


{% include imgur.html title="" ID="https://i.imgur.com/2GsNcr6.png" caption="Student made  an original maze project for me. She needed a little help counting the number of squares to go each step, and I worked with her quite a bit one on one to count steps at each turn. She was all smiles when the project was finished." width="" height="" spacer="" %}



{% include imgur.html title="Run Marco Run" ID="https://i.imgur.com/xCok9A3.gif" caption="Student T2 worked on the challenges on [Run Marco Run](http://runmarco.allcancode.com/). This self-guided lesson serves as an ideal first introduction/review for Scratch. It introduces GUI elements like blocks and block manipulation, and emphasizes thinking ahead as students have to  plan their path through the maze in their head. It gives instant feedback, and by becoming progressively harder helps keeps them challenged and learning new tricks. Student T did a great job making his way through almost all the challenges, and will be ready for Scratch next lesson." width="" height="" spacer="" %}


{% include imgur.html title="" ID="https://i.imgur.com/x0R5Ngv.png" caption="Student H made further progress on his 'Chaos Madness' project. His main goal was to add a sound if the agent was touching the bullet (Sprite1). This only worked when he realized that the block had to be in a forever loop in order to be triggered." width="" height="" spacer="" %}

{% include zakviewer.html Name="2022-04-12 Untitled-14" ID="https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/674338793/" caption="Student J worked on making a maze game, but was disapointed with his result, so he started again. We worked together on aligning a maze he got from the internet so it was centered and the right size." %}
