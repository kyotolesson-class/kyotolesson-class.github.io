   * I have sent students projects or tips on the [classroom page](https://www.tynker.com/dashboard/student/#/my-classes/).
   * Please find these and do the project.
   * Save your work, and send me a "Stream" Chat message about. 
3. If you checked out projects like the Greeting Card Project and Cave World Problem, can you make your own modifications?


### October 19th Class Summary

Today most of the students were working on the Programming 100 Tutorial (see above). From time to time students needed a little help, but most of them worked through the tutorial at their own pace. Students also checked out projects the Greeting Card Project and Cave World Problems.

Some students worked on individual projects, such as a Mario Kart Clone or a My Life project.  Some students are very ambitious in their ideas at this stage, so the main idea today is to take it one step at a time. What happens next? Usually I have to break that down even further until we can figure out what blocks are involved. At that point the kids are usually able to move forward on their own.
