The student made a lot of progress and learned many skills, including:

* Creating a actor using the character studio
  * Animating the actor
  * Make them appear to walk by using a loop
  * Making sure the actor walks only so far with the repeat until block
  * testing for the position with the > condition block
  * adjusting the speed by setting the wait
