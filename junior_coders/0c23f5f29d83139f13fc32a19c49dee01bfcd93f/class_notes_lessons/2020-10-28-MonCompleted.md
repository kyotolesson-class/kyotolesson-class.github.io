Kids may be able to get around Tynker by themselves, but since this is still new, it might be helpful if parents have to time to help them if they have questions. 

Once you have opened the project, save it!! 

Inside the project you can send me message from a **Project Chat**. To create a Project Chat, click the small  grey square next to your user name. Click the blue/green Share button in the Stream to start the Chat. Post a message at the bottom. See this video:

I will automatically be able to see the Chat then. You can also add other students to the chat.



[This Accessing Tynker Page](../class_notes_lessons/../lessons/AccessingTynker.md) gives full directions on finding the homework in general. 

### October 26th Class Summary

This class more kids started working on tutorials. Kids are very ambitious and motivated at this point, and some of them realized this class that doing the tutorials is the way to start climbing the mountain. Making Platforem games like Super Mario seems to be a popular ambition, and so for this week I made Special Guided Tour to making Platform games that kids can use as a way to get there.
