### Recap for February 1st

Space Rush
  : One student wanted to take aa project and change the main character. We had already discussed importing actors, and today we talked about how to make animations with characters. There was also a problem with the "teleport" effect (when the actor leaves the screen at one side and comes back on the other side.) This requires testing for when the actor leaves one edge, and then sending them to opposite edge.

Among Us
  : The student worked on planning the next stage of their an Among Us game. They also started work on a new Platformer game. 

Initializing Tiles
  : In a platform game this student was working on, certain tiles disappear if you captured a certain token. We noticed this week that if you restart the game the tokens remain disappeared. To fix this we had to make sure the tokens are drawn when we start. In the initialization below, one of the tiles has been changed to show which tiles were being changed.

Maze
  : One student made a maze based on a tutorial. Some special modifications included:
  
  : * vary the speed of the motion by changing a wait block.
  : * initialize the size of the actor at the start

  : In the example below, click the mouse to move the tiny fish.

Tic Tac Toe
  : The Tic Tac Toe project continues. 
  
  : The current task is changing the code to use ```switch to  background () :: looks```{: .msb}  instead of ```hide :: looks```{: .msb} for the squares. 
  
  : We decided that to change the code simultaneously on all the squares it is better to make one actor the way we want and duplicate the actor.  
  
  : On the way there, I suggested to the student that it is very helpful to give meaningful names to messages. The student worked on renaming all their messages to more meaningful ones. This involved a bit of debugging to figure out just what each message was doing. This was a very good exercise in analyzing code. 

  In the end, there is still one little piece that isn't working, and they still have to copy all the actors, but all in all they did very good work.
