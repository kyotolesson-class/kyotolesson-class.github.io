### Homework due 2021!

### Recap for December 21st

A Family Story
  : One student work on using pixlr.com to edit actor costumes. She cleaned up an image to remove the background using the magic wand and rectangle tools. 
    
  : Then she worked on creating a conversation between the actors.

Magic The Gathering
  : It was decided that this project was too ambitious for now, and the student decided to find something less ambitious that they might be able to see through to the end

Tutorials
  : Some students decided to work through tutorials. 
    
  
    
Platform Game
  : More students decided ot work on platform games. One problem that comes up is how to make something happen when 2 characters approach each other. For example, in this student's project, when the hero approaches, the villain says they will give them a clue if they manage to defeat them. Here is one solution:

Another student turned this into a conversation, where one character says "You will die", and the other says "Not if I kill you first!". Using messages, we can make this happen.
