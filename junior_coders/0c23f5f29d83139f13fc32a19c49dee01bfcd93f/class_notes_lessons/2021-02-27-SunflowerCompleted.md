### Recap for February 27th


Kimetsu no Yaiba Quiz Festival!
  : Today we worked on making a Kimetsu no Yaiba Quiz Game. This provides practice in sending messages, creating buttons, **Bump** and **Touch** blocks, and creating closing screens, and logic. 
  
The basic game works by having a question posed, and the player navigates to the answer they choose. If the answer is right, they get one message, if the answer is wrong they get a different one.

This is a demo project:
