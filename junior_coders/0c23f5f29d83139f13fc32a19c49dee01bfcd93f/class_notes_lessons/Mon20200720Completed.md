## July 20th 


### July 20th Homework Review 
As usual we did a homework review. Kids are getting more specific with their comments, which is good.


### Review Things that make projects better (Stars!)

Students Brainstormed a list of things that make for a good project

* Creativity
* Teamwork
* No crazy stuff (it should make sense)
* No violence/killing (Be kind)
* Details 
* Interesting characters and backgrounds
* Make clear who is speaking or acting
* Use word bubble and sounds
* Use color
* Make an exit screen
* Beautiful story
* Navigation buttons


### Teamwork 5000 Redux

By popular demand, instead of doing a new Bootup Project, kids wanted to make another Teamwork 5000 project. Each child came up with some ideas and in the end we had four components for kids to tie together into a story:

* Like a movie
* Look at an angel
* Go to a monster house
* Computer Robots

In class kids did a storyboard, and reviewed it with me. Once it was complete, they started their projects.

### July 20th Double Hangman

Again we ended the class with a game of hangman. This time we played double hangman, with 2 boards going at the same time. Double the fun!


### July 20th Homework

The homework is complete the Teamwork 5000 Redux Project and email it to me.
