## July 3rd


[Apologies for posting this late] This week we continued working on learning basic ScratchJr Blocks.

## July 3rd Sharing Time
The kids shared the work they had done by themselves during the week. Kids learned a lot. 

Children created their own versions of projects similar to the following Bootup Projects

1.  Dance Alone
