## July 3rd

[Apologies for the late post] 

This week we continued working on learning basic ScratchJr Blocks.

## July 3rd Sharing Time
The kids shared the work they had done by themselves during the week. Kids learned a lot. 

Children explored using the various motion blocks to create interesting dances. They created their own versions of projects similar to the following Bootup Projects:

1.  Dance Alone
