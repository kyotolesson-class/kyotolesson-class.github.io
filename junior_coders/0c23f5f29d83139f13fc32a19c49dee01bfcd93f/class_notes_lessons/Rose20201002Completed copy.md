### Homework due October 16th

The homework is to continue to work on unfinished projects, especially The Halloween ("Use all the blocks") Project. 

## October 9nd Class Summary

Today, students were mostly at different stages of our progress, working towards completing the Halloween Project. 

One child was reworking her Family Conversation Project, which helped her reinforce the idea of sending messages and parallel actions. In this case that meant planning out simultaneous text to the recorded sounds as the characters spoke. 

Another student worked first on pre-planning her Halloween project and once we reviewed her outline,  she began programming it.

Another student was well along on the Halloween project, but continued to add more to the story.

Meanwhile, another student has moved on to Scratch, and completed the Pong tutorial. 

### Emailing Projects

As I mentioned in person, it would be helpful to me if students could email me projects they complete or are working on so I can review them and get a better sense of their progress and the support they need. I did a brief review with students of how to do this in ScratchJr, though the final step (complete the email) requires adult help. Full details of how to do this are available here: <https://www.scratchjr.org/learn/tips/share-projects>. The email to use is [teacher@kyotolesson.com](mailto:teacher@kyotolesson.com).
