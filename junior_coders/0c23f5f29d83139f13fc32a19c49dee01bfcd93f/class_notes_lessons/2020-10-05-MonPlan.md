## Sharing Projects 

We talked a little about how to share projects with **Studios**, and we shared links to studios so people could follow each other. In the end I found a better way to do this, and I have manually makde everyone follow each other on Scratch, and so it will be easy to share projects from now on. I will explain more about this next week.
