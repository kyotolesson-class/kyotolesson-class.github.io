## Using Zoom

See [Lesson Topics: Zoom](../lessons/usingZoom.html) for a full description.

This was the first time using Zoom, so there was a lot of adjustment to the interface. We didn't cover everything in the Zoom topic, but focused on using Chat to send messages, and played the "I Like" game.

## Game: Black

See [Topic: Game: Black](../lessons/gameBlack.html)
