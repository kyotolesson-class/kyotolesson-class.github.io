### Recap for March 6th

Today we worked on the Sword on the Beach Project. Tanjiro has lost his sword on the beach and we have to find it. This project is great for lots of reasons: it practices sending message, welcome screens, program logic, wait buttons, bump and touch blocks, and visibility and invisibility. The kids were very focused and were all able to finish the project. Kids then went on to work on their own variations. Several found interesting and clever places to hide the sword. Others made variations like a raining dots game using the same concepts, or a chasing game using the same buttons.

  : * **Beach Game** this is the original beach game I gave them. It has 2 levels, an easy one and a hard one. Kids completed the easy level, but not all tried the second level.
