### Homework due March 8th

Do the [tutorial](https://www.tynker.com/play/za-tutorial/60342b84e25d447d91562ac6-556329XkLKUhN7.xk1aXOsgIZT3cEk) on your own.

### Recap for March 1st

Project Preview: Among Us
  : Today I looked at platform games, and how to give a character "lives". 
  
Last week a studenta student asked how to make a character come to life again. There are several ways, and this week I showed how to do it using the **set** and **properties** blocks.

We walked through a [tutorial](https://www.tynker.com/play/za-tutorial/60342b84e25d447d91562ac6-556329XkLKUhN7.xk1aXOsgIZT3cEk) that explains it in detail. The homework is to work through the tutorial again on your own, and try to add something new. Here is what it should look like in the end (press s to shoot, and right arrow to move closer). As you can see, the zombie comes back!!

Aftwerwards, some kids started the homework, and I reviewed how to set uup a platform game from scratch for some students.
