### July 17th Homework

The homework for next class is:

1. Finish the Animal House Project
2. Do the Outer Space and Animal debugging exercises above.

Below is a summary of what we did in class.

### July 17th Homework Review: Outer Space

We reviewed and developed the [Outer Space project](./scratchProjects/Y1R17Outerspace.sjr). Kids watched the project run and tried to make their own similar code. One key idea was **having two or more actions happen at the same time**. For example, click the astronaut link below, and you can see the astronaut does 3 actions at the same time: 

1. He turns, 
2. moves up, and 
3. shrinks then disappears.

This creates the effect of him spinnin off into space and disappearing. This trick is very important in ScratchJr.

#### Debugging: Outer Space

Here are some problems to solve:

{% include niceimage-galleryNoTables.html folder="/scratchProjects/Y1R17OuterspaceDebugging/" %}

1. Why doesn’t the sun spin when pressed?
2. Why does the alien stay in the air and not hop back down?
3. Why doesn’t the shooting star hide after it shrinks?
4. Why doesn’t the astronaut fly up when pressed?

#### Debugging: Outer Space Answers
1. It needs the start on tap trigger
2. The move up block needs to be replaced with a hop block
3. The show block needs to be replaced with a hide block
4. The number (parameter) on the move up block needs to be greater than 0

### July 17 Break

We played Hangman during the break, and it was a lot of fun. For a change, the kids worked together to choose a word ("Doctor") that I had to guess. They almost stumped me!

### Animal House

We then moved to making characters talk, either by recording sounds, or adding text bubbles. Our  model was the Animal House Project from BootUp.

The kids worked on their own version of the project, and the homework was to finish the project. 


#### Debugging: Animal House

Here are some debugging exercises.

{% include niceimage-galleryNoTables.html folder="/scratchProjects/Y1R18AnimalhouseDebugging/" %}


1. Why does the barn get bigger and not bigger, then smaller?

2. Why does the chicken play a pop sound and not the recorded sound?

3. Why does the horse play the same recording twice instead of two different recordings?

#### Debugging: Animal House Answers

1. The second grow block should be a shrink block

2. The pop block sound be a play recorded sound block

3. The second play recorded sound block should have a number 2 and not a number 1
