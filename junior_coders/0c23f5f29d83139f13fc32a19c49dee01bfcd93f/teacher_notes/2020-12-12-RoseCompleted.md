### Recap for December 11th

Only one student today. We worked mostly on mastering the Image Editor. The stamp tool and paint bucket tools were especially fun.

These tools are sometimes not intuitive, and can react slowly or inconsistently. It takes some practice to be able to use them to get desired results, and sometimes the best way to learn is just experiment with it. I also demonstrated how to make a basic animation from several images in sequence. 

After that the student started in on the Barbie Hour of Code project that just became available on Tynker this month. The project is easy but cute, and the student seemed to enjoy it and be able to do it without much assistance despite a difference in language. The final part was left as homework.

We finished up with a few games of hangman. Even if kids have some English proficiency, if they learned English as a second language some basic skills such as vocabulary, writing characters correctly, pronunciation,  or spelling tricks can have gaps, and the way we play hangman is modified to help support these.
