## February 12th

### Homework due February 19th

Keep working on knock knock jokes.

### Recap for February 12th

Today I taught kids about [Knock Knock Jokes](../lessons/KnockKnockJokes.html) and [Bad Jokes](../lessons/JokesForBadJokes.html) 


#### ScratchJr.

For the ScratchJr. kids, I showed them this project, and then they worked to create it themselves. They then added their own screens with more jokes.

This is the joke I started with. Notice the color of the [**Send and Receive Blocks**{: style="color: darkgreen;background-color: yellow"}]. 

A: [**Green Flag**{: style="color: darkgreen;background-color: yellow"}] Knock Knock [**Send ORANGE**{: style="color: orange;background-color: yellow"}]
<br>B: [**Receive ORANGE**{: style="color: orange;background-color: yellow"}] Who's there? [**Send BLUE**{: style="color: blue;background-color: yellow"}]

A: [**Receive BLUE**{: style="color: blue;background-color: yellow"}] Wooden Shoe [**Send GREEN**{: style="color: green;background-color: yellow"}]
<br>B: [**Receive GREEN**{: style="color: green;background-color: yellow"}] Wooden Shoe who? [**Send PURPLE**{: style="color: purple;background-color: yellow"}]

A: [**Receive PURPLE**{: style="color: purple;background-color: yellow"}] Wooden Shoe like me to tell you another joke? 
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;= *(Wouldn't you like me to tell you another joke?.)*

Here is what it looks like for A in ScratchJr.

The kids started working on it but it was a bit more difficult that in ScratchJr. We'll work on it some more next week.
