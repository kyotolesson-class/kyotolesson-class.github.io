## November 23rd

### Homework due November 30th

The homework is either keep adding to the project we were working on, or start a new project! I am still deciding what we will do next week, but probably will focus on movement blocks.

### Recap for November 23rd

Kids continued working on the conversation project. First we continued adding more to the existing conversation and kids were quite creative and silly in their conversations, and they were having a lot of fun (and learning too). This class we also made the projects more realistic by adding animations to the actor using animate and wait blocks. Combining this with the say and send  and receive and say (from last week) creates a nice conversation:

Kids enjoyed exploring the different animations available, and also jazzing up the appearance of the actors using the character editor.
