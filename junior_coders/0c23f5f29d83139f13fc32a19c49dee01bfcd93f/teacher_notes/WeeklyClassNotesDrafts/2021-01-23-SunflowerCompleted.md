## January 23rd

### Homework due January 30th

Make a new project, this time with a chase. 


### Recap for January 23rd

This week we made square mazes, and used the bump block.

to collect "tokens", just like in a MarioKart type game.

The kids made their own version. As usual they had a lot of fun designing new characters.

The homework is to make another square maze, but instead of collecting tokens, this time the characters play tag. As each character is bumped, they move on to the next character. Here is a sample.
