### Recap for January 15th

New Students and ScratchJr.
  : Two students joined our class today, and we continued with the introduction to ScratchJr from their trial lesson. We reviewed their homework project, and then did a basic review of the purple, green and orange blocks. At this point I challenged them to explore freely what they could do with the blocks they knew at this point, and this is their homework for next week. In class one project was notable for making three characters move together in unison and stopping at the edge of the screen.

Knock Knock Jokes
  : After doing many tutorials, one girl started to work on a basic project, a knock knock joke project. She decided she wanted to change the stock actor the project came with, and got very excited at all teh characters, especially the mermaids, that are available in the media library. After exploring this for a while she asked if we could make the Mermaid King's flippers move as if he were swimming. This is actually hard to do in Tynker, but I walked through the simple cut, paste, and rotate actions that are part of partially creating that effect. She also made some other modifications to the Mermaid King, like changing the color of his sword.

Tutorials
  : Lastly, another student worked independently on finishing up the Barbie Pets Tutorial, and continuing on a Christmas-themed project. She had a small question about one section of the tutorial, but eventually got it. The ability to work independently is a sign of increased confidence and mastery.
