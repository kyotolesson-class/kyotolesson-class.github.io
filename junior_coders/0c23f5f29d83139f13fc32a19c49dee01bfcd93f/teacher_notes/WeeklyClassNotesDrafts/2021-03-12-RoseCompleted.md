### Recap for March 12th


Tynker
  : Great progress today as most students worked on variations of the Beach game.
 
One student worked on moving the main character with keypresses, and sending and receiving messages. Then she learned how to detect if characters are touching.

Another student created an interest "Dropping Hearts" effect when the characters was touched. This involved sending a message to both the actor touched and to the cherry effect.

We also talked about how to make the motions smoother or faster or longer.

Students needing review worked with the tutorials including one student who moved up from ScratchJr. to Tynker today.

Scratch Jr.
  : Today we worked on a Kimetsu No Yaiba Sword Game. Just from watching the project once, the student  was able to figure out how to recreate it.

  : * A basic Kimetsu no Yaiba Sword game. Note that the arrows move the actor, and also keep the actor on screen. When the sword hits, the actor says hit.
