### Recap for April 19th

#### In-person class

Virus Shooter
  : I worked on a game with student H. We planned out the game, which involves a character shooting spray paint at bad guys. I asked what the overall goal of the game was, and he said there was no real goal but to go around shooting people. However, after a while he came up with an idea involving exterminating a virus. We got to the point where we designed the main character, a villain, and a paintgun. He wanted to do some modifications on a stock character so we learned to use the image editor to flip elements, and group and ungroup elements.

This is a mockup of what part of the project might look like once we are finished:

Witch and Goblins game
  : I prompted Student M to come up with a story for his project, and to try ot develop more variety in his games. He came up with a new game idea involving a wizard, some goblins trying to capture a village, and boss goblins. The goal is to capture a treasure, and we worked together how to make music play when the treasure is touched. I again suggested developing the story more, such as adding more options and actions in the game, and adding other characters or other possible actions for the wizard. This is something we will continue to work on.

### Zoom class

We also had a Zoom class for some students who couldn't attend the in-person class. The students worked on doing the **Comic Strip** tutorial, which students were invited to do and modify.

Student A decided to make the strip a series of jokes. On his own he used message blocks to make the conversation, but the result was somewhat flat. I prompted him to make the page more dynamic, for example including adding animation when they speak, and movements. He began doing that and the result is better, and will continue for homework.

A second student A had some questions about the text bubbles, such as the set pen size, color, and set font blocks, so we walked through an explanation of what the blocks did and created some examples of various settings. The student also learned about the difference between a **plain say block** and a **say for X seconds** block. Then we added an animation using a next costume loop.
