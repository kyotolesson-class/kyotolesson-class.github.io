### Recap for February 6th

Airdrop
  : After working through some technical issues we were able to set up airdrop on kids' computers so they could share their projects with the teacher more easily.  

Race to the Finish
  : Today's ScratchJr. project was a variation of the race to the finish project. This served as a gentle introduction to using messages and making buttons.

In this project:

1. On the first screen we touch the characters to make them move 
2. If the character touches the finish line, they say something.
3. The finish line is not visible because it is the same color as the background.
  
We reviewed the 2 keys to making messages:

1. Messages have 2 parts: a sender and a receiver
2. The color of the message must be the same for both.


Student Gallery
  : The gallery below shows some projects kids did inspired by this project:
