## June 20th

### Farewell Party

Next week we will have a small farewell party for one of our students, with, per request, popcorn and jelly beans. It will be low-key, and so students don't need to bring anything special for it, unless they want to.


### Recap for June 20th

#### Project of the Day: Slash Knight

We started out with a review of the game Slash Knight. This game is popular now among the students, and I showed them a EZ version of the game. The purpose was give them some insight into how a real, complete game is coded. I walked through a stepped set of projects showing how the game is build up in stages. These have been collected in this [Studio](https://scratch.mit.edu/studios/29935748/). Here is the simplified game.

We then showed how (relatively easy it is) to add a new level to my simplified game by making a group project.

{% include zakviewer.html Name="SKEZ Group Work" ID="https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/546680246/" caption="" %}

Adding a level is easy.

1. Find the 3 `ADD NEW LEVEL here::custom`{: .msb}  blocks. There is one in the KNIGHT, the door, and the interactives. Add just above it a block similar to this one:

```
if <(the number of the level we are on) = [3]> then // In this case 3, 
set [x v] to [-120] // change this to the new starting x 
set [y v] to [48] // and y
end
```
{: .msb}


SKEZ with green knight and bus
  : Student H started his own mod of my SKEZ project. He changed the KNIGHT to a green guy, and the door for a bus.

Independence and Creativity
  : Student A finished some projects on her own last week. Great Job! Her creativity is wonderful.

For the Animal Contest, I helped her add a tts voice.

Here there is some nice storytelling.

She also worked on the Chase Game tutorial today.

Busy Busy
:   Student M was quite busy today. He started by adding some music to his my Explosion Game.

Then he completed the Falling Trails   and Cats and Dogs tutorials

Finally, he even put in some work on Space Cowboy

Wrong Pong Strong Pong
  : Student A added another paddle to his Pong Project. He got a little stuck because his paddles were moving in all sorts of directions. A quick explanation of  `point in direction ()`{: .msb} soon fixed that. 

{% include zakviewer.html Name="" ID="https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/546207368/" caption="Nice Game over screen! Use the arrow and w/s keys to move the paddles." %}

Cheesy Show and Tell
  : We also had a new student today, who will be joining us for a few weeks. They (preferred pronoun) made their first scratch project today, but it was a hit during today's show and tell. We worked together on making the letters flash. Great first project.

He also started a Chase Game tutorial, which he called Cake and Apple. He started to add a new level when the score reaches 30

Soccer Game
  : Student R and I talked about how to make the second level of his game, the soccer game. To make the ghost play, we needed blocks for left and right movement. We fixed sum code because of a Japanese ãƒ¼ instead of a hyphen -. We had to repurpose the w key ofr this screen to shoot the ball, not move up, so we added a a test for which layer you were on and changing he function accordingly.

The ball is shot using this block:

### Recap for June 18th


Combining Projects
  : Student R used teh backpack to import the Actors from another tutorial into this one to make the 4th level of her Moving Gus project. This is still a work in progress.


Swordfight
  : After I had made some cleanup to his code, student YY found a bug and worked hard to find the source. I showed him how to sequence the routines with a main loop, and he began adding further routines.


{% include imgur.html title="" ID="https://i.imgur.com/122oYUt.png" caption="Using a sequence of broadcast messages it is easy to follow the main flow of the program." width="" height="" spacer="" %}


ScratchJr.
  : Several ScratchJr. students worked on a variant of Mario. The project involved sending messages to more than one sprite at a time to make them appear and disppear in sequence. We went step by step and most were able to complete it. 


Mermaid
  : Student A's achievement for the day was finally being able to log in all by herself (an ongoing struggle)! Together we reviewed some code for putting her candy at the right level, and she worked on making a "game over" screen.

Fixing the error in Tynker Instructions

I discovered 3 errors in the Tynker Instructions. 

* The first is that in Tynker it says

{% include imgur.html title="" ID="https://i.imgur.com/L3dy0us.png" caption="" width="" height="" spacer="" %}

but there is no TynkerBlocks section or Actor costume. 

* Secondly, they omitted the step before this, which is to add a variable called Score. 

* Third, their code is wrong. 

Here is how to fix these errors:

1. In the Blocks area, click CREATE VARIABLE, and add a GLOBAL (very important) variable named score. 

![Imgur](https://i.imgur.com/A1DDdfd.png)

1. Then, then, in the block area, click on the new variable you created (it will then look like the above) and click on the button marked add watcher. This creates the block that was missing.

The watcher will have this code:
![Imgur](https://i.imgur.com/XnkBY6I.png)

Change the word Hero to stage
![Imgur](https://i.imgur.com/3wp8fev.png)


3. Then, where Tynker says to add this `send message [addscore] to [score] with [] :: #ff8c1a`{: .msb}  add a `change [score] by (1)`{: .msb} block instead.

Tynker has many such errors, but this is one of the worst.

next week get kids to clean up their wrokspaces. expecially tynker.
