### Recap for May 7th

Tynker
  : Today I introduced the following project demonstrating how to use animate blocks and idle blocks so that speech is natural. 

The key to this was using an Animate block paired with "time-consuming" blocks (like wait, glide, or say) that has the same duration.

![Imgur](https://i.imgur.com/MQlWOxn.png){: .jsgif}
  : * The animation lasts for 4 seconds, and the say, glide, and wait take up 4 seconds.

You can see the code above in action when the second actor moves back from the center. The fourth and fifth actors were for kids to code themselves, and they worked individually on this. The kids also mischievously enjoyed adding new characters, like dinosaurs, to my project while I wasn't looking. " %}



Scratch Jr.
  : Student K worked on making a path maze from a linear maze. He added the idea of moving cars to make the game more challenging!

### Recap for May 8th

Intro to Scratch
  : Today was an introduction to Scratch day for students M and N. There was some setup involved, such as installing Chrome, adding the "Scratch Addons" extension to help them use scratch. I have assigned each student a login ID and password, that they should use for all their classwork. Using an assigned account allows me to better manage and track their progress. Once they were successfully logged in, we went to we started a blank project we walked through the first tutorial. 

  : Students M and N then learned how to use the move block, play sounds. We worked through adding sounds from the music library and from files on your hard drive. Likewise for costumes, we learned how to add costumes from the costume library and the kids started working on drawing their favorite characters.

  : * Student M played with the image editor to make a cat in a basket!

Cat and Panther Game
  : Student R, a more advanced scratch student continued worked on a chase game involving a cat chasing a panther protecting a crystal from a cat and getting points. He had some questions about how to play sounds and how to change the background. He was able to make it keep score.
  
```
when gf clicked
forever 
if <touching (1 v) ?> then 
change [スコア v] by (1)
end
if <(スコア) > (49)> then 
switch backdrop to (1 v) ::looks
hide
play sound (1 v) until done
end
end

```
{: .msb}


We worked together on code that would allow it the game to stop once it reached a certain score. We will need to talk about how to reset the game when it starts/finishes. We made a list of the things would be that would happen when the target score was reach, and we used a conditional if block with a test operator block to code the motion.

ScratchJr.
  : The scratch junior kids worked on making mazes. Student Y continued working on his maze from last week. Student R made a new maze based on the linear maze turning a linear maize into a traditional pathway maze. Student H worked on various projects on his own.

![Imgur](https://i.imgur.com/iVFIeZR.png){: .jsgif}
  : * This is a linear maze

![Imgur](https://i.imgur.com/tJykOLL.png){: .jsgif}
  : * Here we surround the linear maze with blue walls

![Imgur](https://i.imgur.com/0lc87hg.png){: .jsgif}
  : * Next we remove the original maze, leaving just the walls

![Imgur](https://i.imgur.com/3k8pIib.jpg){: .jsgif}
  : * Here is a more complicated example. The black is the solution path, and the blue are false paths. The red is the walls.

  : * If we remove the black and blue lines, we get the final maze.

### Recap for May 9th

My Favorite Things
  : Student A1 worked adapted the "My Favorite Things" project focusing on his favorite things: Blue, Golf, and Korean Food. The project is still incomplete, but the section on Korean food is working.
  
{% include tynkerprojectpage.html Name="05 11 My Favorite Things" ID="https://www.tynker.com/play/05-11-my-favorite-things/60998bf30381e277a77bbb74-348138Xkq1kH5Cm1FI2LoHeTOoiIck" caption="" %}


Comic Book Project
  : Student A2 is working on her comic book project. We worked very closely to make the characters reappear in the second panel and then make the characters choose the right costumes, talk and move. She is becoming more comfortable using messages to sequence activities, but needed to be reminded to give each message a unique name.

Rocket Ship Game
  : With Student M started a new project. First he did a project that was mostly about making as much noise as possible. We then tried to work on a project that would involve more direct coding, and came up with a project about two ships shooting at each other. Below is a sample of how that game might work. This is mostly stock code, but the critical change is that the explosion should happen only if the character is hit by the correct laser, not by just *any* actor:

![Imgur](https://i.imgur.com/nRC0aSI.png){: .jsgif style="width:200px"} &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ![Imgur](https://i.imgur.com/tqxB5Y4.png){: .jsgif style="width:200px"} 
  : * Default condition is "**touching &lt;any&gt;**", but we want "**touching &lt;green laser&gt;**"

Among Us 
  : Student H continued working on a Scratch project. He imported some Among Us characters, and we worked on making the character appear to walk by switching costumes using code like this:
```
when @greenFlag clicked
go to x: (0) y: (0)
repeat (10)
    next costume
    move (10) steps
    wait (.2) seconds
end
```
{: .msb}

The student was challenged to explain why the the character was starting in the middle of the screen, and we talked about how to find the x and y coordinates of a character. Change the goto does the trick:

```
go to x: (-275) y: (0)
```
{: .msb}
