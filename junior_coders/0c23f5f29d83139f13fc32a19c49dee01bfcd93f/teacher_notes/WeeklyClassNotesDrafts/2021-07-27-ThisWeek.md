### Recap for July 24th

Today we had only 2 students. Student H worked on the Chase Game tutorial. He was very creative in modifying the cat character, and made a rather fun project.

Student R and I had an extensive conversation about the [Tech Kids Grand Prix](https://techkidsschool.jp/grandprix/), which he plans to participate in. We discussed the basic criteria of the contest, Vision, Product, and Presentation, and I told him that first we will work on Vision. This is the moment where we seek inspiration and creativity to create an original and inventive project. 

One way to do this is to look at what other people have done, and he looked at several projects by other participants. Then I asked him to critique the projects, to develop his analytical ability and help him be able to see projects from an outside  point of view such as a judge or a player. I asked him to rate the projects according to the contest criteria, and then we focused on what he particularly liked about one project. Then we decided to build our own test project that would include these qualities. 

To come up with a theme for this test project, I encouraged him to come up with a topic that is interesting and inspiring for him. This led him to suggest electronics. After asking him to tell me a little about this, we talked about what is electricity. With some improvements for realism, we had a basic model of electricity in a wire, and we then began to develop how this could be a game. We made a rough mockup of the screen, and then once we were happy with that, I gave him the homework of making a more accurate mock up. We talked about how the user would interact with the game, and what the object of the game would be.

All in all, in one class, we were able to run throught the basic first steps involved in creating an original project. The test project is not intended as his final project, but I think it will help him understand the steps that help take something from nothing, to first idea, to first model, to first prototype. This was a great first step and he did a great job moving through it though we were going rather quickly.

### Recap for July 26th


Today kids worked on their own projects mostly. 

Importing GIFs
  : Student H learned that he could import gif files easily into Scratch, and it would extract the images inside it. This inspired him to make a "comical" project with some of his favorite gifs.

Singer
  : For this project, Student H made the singer sing using if key pressed and repeat until not pressed blocks.

Duck Breaks Egg
  : Student S invented his own Duck Breaks Egg game, where the arrow keys are used to make the Duck break the egg. At first one could only break one egg per game. I challenged him to make it so we could press space button to keep playing. We also displayed the score. Once he managed that I challenged him ot make the game progressively harder, such as by changing the speed of the egg's getaway.

Spin Launcher 
: Student M completed the following Spin Launcher Tutorial. This project teaches about program physics, such as velocity, friction, and restitution.

He also continued his favorite activity, making impossible projects with large number fo actors, and no  way to win!

Singer, Piano, and Guitar
  : Student A completed this music tutorial. For our modification of it, she learned how to change the costume color of the singer when we click her.

### Recap for July 26th

Student M did a makeup class today. He came up with the idea of making  a roulette game. This gave us a chance to use the wait until and repeat until blocks blocks.
