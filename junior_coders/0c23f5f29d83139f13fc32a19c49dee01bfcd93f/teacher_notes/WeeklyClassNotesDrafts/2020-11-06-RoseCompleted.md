## November 6th

### Homework due November 13th

The homework is continue what you can. If you are starting Tynker, I suggest doing the "Programming 100" and "Barbie" activities that you can see by choosing "Friday and Monday Tynker Class" on your dashboard.

### Recap for November 6th

This week we finished the outstanding ScratchJr Projects. One final hurdle was making text and sound happen together, and knowing to put the final message block on the longer of the two, otherwise the next message (the end screen) starts too soon. I have been impressed with how diligent and patient the kids have been. I can see they are enjoying coding and problem solving.

Now all the students are ready to start on Tynker. Some students started or continued working on the tutorials. Kids are mostly able to do the exercises but need some help reading and understanding the instructions at first. Also, there were some technical difficulties with Tynker related to scrolling on certain ipads, though other don't have the problem. For this reason, next week, instead of working individually, we will work as a group on doing the project. 

Tynker has pros and cons. The pros are that:

* the quality of the graphics is much better
* it has capabilities that scratch and scratch junior doesn't have, such are ready made tools for Mario type and other games. This means students can make more satisfying and realistic games and projects.
* it still has all the capabilities tha scratch/scratchjr have
* I can follow student progress more easily, including giving help in real | times: 1

Some of the cons:

* a bit of a learning curve. It is a new interface, and is less visual than scratchjr.
* not as well documented. The positive view is that this encourages experimentation.
* some bugs, quirks, and compatibility issues. In the long run these should be minor problems (I hope).

Since this is a transition, there will be some bumps, but I am confident about the end goal of the journey. Hang in there!!
