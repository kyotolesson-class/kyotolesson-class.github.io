### Recap for March 13th

Ninja Sword Game
  : This week we worked on variations of a simple sword game. This project used messages to send the arrow, and loops to keep the characters moving. The timing is important. Kids worked very hard and creatively on this. Sometimes they added sounds and interesting graphics. 

Today everybody worked hard! One nice things is we had a lot of kids teaching kids which is really great. After seeing the project, kids then worked on making their own version.

One thing stressed today was how to think about the order in which things happens. With some kids I spend some one-on-one time walking through each step so they could see how the code action moves go from one thing to another. The class was loosely structured, with some kids working on their own projects and other kids using the project of the day as a springboard. Here are two great examples:

üëç: * In this version, Tanjiro has to kill 3 demons. The student came up with the clever motion that makes the game much harder. In the end, he hits the King!!
