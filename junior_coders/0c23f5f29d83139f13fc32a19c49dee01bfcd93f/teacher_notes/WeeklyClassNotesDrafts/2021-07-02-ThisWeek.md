### Recap for July 4th

Today we worked as a group on a new project, based on Mario Galaxy 4. I broke the orignal project down into steps, and we walked through them as a group. The kids were really focused and we managed to get through 2 1/2 steps. The kids were able to individualize their projects, and, even if the code is almost the same, each one has a unique character to it.

### Recap for June 2nd

Omission from last week.
  : I omitted a discussion of the Space Invaders ScratchJr. Project in last week's class notes. Please see last week's entry for the omitted information.


Space invaders
  : At the start of class, some ScratchJr. students continued working on space invaders. To make it easier, we divided the project into 2 parts, and the kids worked on each part.

Quiz
  : Today's project was a quiz game. The children started on it by making questions. Some did math questions, another did Curious George Questions.

Sword Fight
  : Continuing on his excellent work, Student Y added the "last team fight" and "trophy time" stages to his Sword Fight project. We got trophies from the internet and I showed him how to remove the background with pixlr background remover.

The winner does a victory dance with his trophies." %}

Doodle Jump
  : Student R continued working on the Doodle jump tutorial. This tutorial has a few mistakes in it:

### Recap for June 3rd



Soccer Game
  : During the makeup class for student R, I showed him how to clean up his project by combining stacks. Instead of several green flag stacks and several forever loops, we combined them all. The next day we worked on finishing the soccer game level. One problem was that the ball would get stuck in a corner sometimes; we prevented this by moving the ball away when it touched the goalkeeper. 

{% include zakviewer.html Name="Soccer Game" ID="https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/530891031/" caption="We also made the ball return when a goal is scored. I also showed him how to use a repeated move block to make the ball glide. This helps make recording goals and deflections work better." %}

Jukebox
  : Student M did a great job making the last few songs on his jukebox work. 
  
{% include zakviewer.html Name="Juke Box" ID="https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/550655784/" caption="He go so excited, he decided to add 4 more songs, which need to be coded." %}

Another Jukebox
  : Student Y was inspired from watching this Jukebox to begin making his own. 




Crazy Animation
  : Student N has been learning how to make animations, and produced this Crazy Animation Project.

{% include zakviewer.html Name="" ID="https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/550356223/" caption="It uses both color effects and costume changes for the transitions" %}

Learning ABC
  : He also taught Abu, his favorite character, to speak.

Clickers
  : A popular game this week was a clicker game, which several students played or worked on. These are very simple. Just click until you drop. Simple, but popular.

Normal means I am facing in the same clock direction. Moving Clockwise and facing clockwise. Anticlockwise if I am facing anticlockwise.
Backing up means I am facing in a different clock direction. Backing up clockwise means I am moving clockwise, but facing anticlockwise. Backing up anticlockwise means moving anticlockwise, but facing clockwise.

Three things are changing:
1. rotating Clockwise or Anticlockwise. Clockwise + Anticlockwise -  
2. Facing with clock direction + , or facing against against clock direction - . This decides if I am moving normally  or backing up.

But there is also:
3. moving positive or negative steps. This can change clockwise to anticlockwise, or anticlockwise to clockwise.
  * Clockwise positive = (++) is clockwise. Anticlockwise positive (-+) is anticlockwise. Clockwise negative (+-), is anticlockwise. Anticlockwise negative (--) is clockwise.  

Assume I am going clockwise, so the first character below is a +. Assume I am going positively. The second character is + too. Now, I can either go normal or back up. I can face the clock direction + , or go against it +: 

++ = + Normal Clockwise  rotating clockwise, moving positive and facing same +.
++ ≂̸ - Backing up clockwise.  rotating clockwise, moving positive but I am facing opposite -, so backing up.

If I am going negative steps, the clockwise is changed to anticlockwise. I can still back up or go normal, but now I am moving anticlockwise. Again, I may however be still facing clockwise, +, so I would be backing up. Or I could be facing anticlockwise, but now moving anticlockwise, so I am moving normally!!!:
+- ≂̸ + Backing up anticlockwise. rotating clockwise, but moving negative steps, i.e. anticlockwise. Facing + clockwise though, so backing up. 
+- = - Normal Anticlockwise! rotating clockwise, but moving negative steps, i.e. anticlockwise. facing - (anticlockwise), too, so I am moving normally, but anticlockwise.

If I am moving anticlockwise, normal is facing anticlockwise, so facing + means ANTICLOCKWISE.
-+ ≂̸ + Normal Anticlockwise. Moving anticlockwise, positive steps, So I am moving anticlockwise, and facing anticlockwise too. Normal.
-+ = - Backing up Anticlockwise. Moving anticlockwise with positive steps. So I am moving anticlockwise, but facing opposite. So I am backing up.

-- = + Backing up Clockwise!  Moving anticlockwise, but negative steps, so I am moving clockwise. But facing anticlockwise, so I am backing up!
-- ≂̸ - Normal Clockwise!! I am moving anticlockwise, but negative steps, so I am moving clockwise. But, I am facing clockwise too, so I am moving normally.

Not helpful but true:
for clockwise, = means Normal, ≂̸ means Backing up
for anticlockwise = means Backing up, ≂̸ means Normal

The think to keep track of is am I moving normally or backing up. Then I need to know am I moving clockwise or anticlockwise.
