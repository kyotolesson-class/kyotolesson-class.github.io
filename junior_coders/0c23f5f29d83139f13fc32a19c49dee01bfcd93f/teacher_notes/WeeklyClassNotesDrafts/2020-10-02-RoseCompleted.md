### Homework due October 9th

The homework is to continue to work on unfinished projects, specifically The Family Conversation and Halloween ("Use all the blocks") Projects. 

## October 2nd Class Summary

Students continued to work on unfinished projects. 

One student has a small bug in her Family Conversation. Her characters were not speaking in the correct order. This gave her a good experience at debugging and carefully working through the code and message logic (with help) to find the source of the problem. 

Another student worked on adding simultaneous text to the recorded sounds the character spoke.

Students also learned that since ScratchJr limits each character to 5 recorded sounds, it is better to record continuous recordings as one. This is a kind of "refactoring" that comes up often in programming as the limits of a given framework are reached. 

### Tynker

All the students in this class are familiar with all the ScratchJr blocks. Once they finished with these or a few more projects, I think we will actually be ready to move on to Scratch. In fact, I am considering moving to an improved version of Scratch I recently discovered called "Tynker". Tynker is almost identical to Scratch, but also has some improvements. It has additional blocks that are easier to understand. It has better images and drawing. 

It also allows me to observe and collaborate with students as they work in real time. As a result, it is easier to give students individual support, especially for kids who are at different levels. It is easier to create tutorials and exercises. 

Tynker is web-based and does not require installation of software. In addition, it is similar enough to Scratch that learning one effectively allows you to use the other. 

One advanced student did a trial run of Tynker with me this class and gave a favorable review. 

One issue is that students need at least a keyboard, and perhaps a mouse to use it fully. I mentioned this to parents, but please let me know if you any questions about requirements for your situation. Tynker is free to use, though it also offers (and sells somewhat aggressively) paid upgrades, which I don't plan to use in this class. They are not necessary at this point and have the potential at this point to be distracting rather than enlightening. Tynker, like Scratch and ScratchJr, does have some bugs and quirks, but so far none has been critical.

You do not need to sign up, as I have created accounts for the students already, and will provide login information at the right time.
