### Recap for March 8th

Today kids worked on their own projects. 

Platformer Game: Making a Bad Guy React to an Approaching Good Guy
  : Platformers are still popular, but kids are now starting to want to customize their games more.

One question that came up for several students was how to make the bad guy react when the good guy is near. For example, the bad guy could tell him about the presence of awards and bad guys, or could make clones of himself, or give a riddle to be solved.

  : * A **when [] occurs** holding a  **distance to []** block can detect the good guy, and then we can code our reaction.

Brickbreaker
  : Another student worked hard on a classic brickbreaker game. The tutorial she was working off of was rather fast and hard to follow, so we walked through it together. It involved the very difficult concept of nested loops. We also reviewed static and active blocks, and true versus false.

  : * The brickbreaker game is a classic

  : * **This loop** draws the bricks. It draws all the columns in one row and then the next. Getting the numbers right is tricky.

  : * **The Paddle is Active and Static** Active means it can feel hits. Static means it doesn't move if it is hit. It doesn't receive "kicks".

![the ball is active, but not static](https://i.imgur.com/HN1QJvb.png){: .jsgif }
  : * **The Ball** can move, and it can receive "kicks" (impulses). Restitution means that it keeps all its energy when it bounces. An friction means it doesn't stick to the paddle.


Doodle Jump
  : Another tutorial was not that difficult but had outdated code in it for making a scoreboard, and I had to create an up-to-date version. Luckily, the newer method is much simpler. Note the nice scoreboard in the final project.
