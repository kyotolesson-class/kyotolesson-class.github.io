Mario Projects
  : Students are intrigued by these but they are a bit beyond their skill. We have covered some of the basic steps in class, and kids will often modify these.

Solar Panel Project
  : A student is developing a project to model a solar panel. It includes the influence of weather (reducing output, breakage), maintenance costs, and a power meter. We talked about general goals of the project, such as how user input would change the game. This projecct is a candidate for entry in a coding competition.

### Recap for September 6th

Today we (nearly) finished making the basic Mario game based on Grey. We added more levels and made the flag switch the levels.

{% include zakviewer.html Name="Student M" ID="https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/564897209/" caption="" %}

{% include zakviewer.html Name="Student H" ID="https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/564897884/" caption="" %}

{% include zakviewer.html Name="Student S" ID="https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/564896942/" caption="" %}

One student learned how to change his profile and downsize and image. We talked about the fact that the move block needs to know which direction to move, and that moving in a negative direction moves backwards.

Student K joined us for the first time today. They made a somewhat different version of the game, focusing more on blocks they were familiar with. For example, they struggled with making the cat move up and down, and hardcoded the movement with set y blocks rather than using change y by blocks. They worked on making the cat face in different dirrections.


Instead of levels, they made individual platforms. This is just a different way of doing this project, and a good way to reinforce what you know while building to new skills. Towards the end we added some new blocks, such as if and sensing blocks to test for contact.

We also had a ScratchJr. Student who continued working on their Issun-b≈çshi (Tom Thumb) Story, and remaking sample projects.

when I receive [next level]
next costume
```
{: .msb}


to paddle. and remove code touching flag code from paddle.

HU: needs to make flag separate from Sprite 1. Needs when touching flag code for next level.

SAK: Project works, but he said he needs more explanation of how it works.



NEXT WEEK:

review projects and fix MI and HU and K
