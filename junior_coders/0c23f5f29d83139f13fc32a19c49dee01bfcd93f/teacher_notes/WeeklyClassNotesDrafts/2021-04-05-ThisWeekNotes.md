### Homework due April 9th

### Recap for April 2nd 

ScratchJr.
  : We did an introductory class for some new students focusing on using the image editor. For other ScratchJr. students, this week's project was a **Chicken Crossing** game. 

Chicken Crossing
  : In this classic game, click the chicken and get past the cars. Our version includes several levels.

One student was able to recreate the project pretty well just by watching it run. The chicken gets across in stages, which adds challenge. Nice project.

The project itself is simple, using just a few blocks

but gives good practice in reusing code and also has many opportunities for variations. For example, the occasional back-step in the truck code adds a bit of challenge. 

Tynker
  : In Tynker, the **Beach Project** and variations made some headway.

Snowboarder
  : One student is working on a variation of the Beach Project where a snowboarder finds candy on the slopes. She was able to make the snowboard move, and is working on making the snowboarder react to the good and bad candy.

Mermaid
  : Another student is working on sending messages when her mermaid touches the candy. When she touches the bad candy, she goes back to her home place.

She has also added code for the good candy.

## Recap for April 3rd 
  : As in last week, kids were into continuing to develop their previously learned skills, and sharing projects with each other to copy. One child made an attempt at the project of the day.

This week's project was a chicken crossing game. Players the chicken to get past the cars. It includes several levels of successive difficulty. 

{% include giphy.html link="https://media.giphy.com/media/4GOIrt8uOxBKfyp4FG/" %} 

One child started to make an attempt at this project, but in kids became quite busy project sharing and discussing recent projects. They then started recording themselves talking, and eventually recorded the currently popular song Usseewa into a project. Their homework is to turn this into a project. 

(Note: we don't usually allow internet use unless it is directly related to a project. You might want to remind your child of that.)

One child submitted an interesting experiment as homework. Clicking the black button sends the yellow star back and forth. However, each new level introduces more copies (2, 4, 6, 8) of the back and forth loop, which speeds up the movement. This kind of controlled speeding up is not possible otherwise in ScratchJr.

### Recap for April 5th

Students were not able to agree on a project to work on together, so they started out on individual projects.

Helicopter Shooting Game
  : The biggest challenge of the day was a student who wanted to make a shooting game, only without using the pre-set shoot and attack blocks. While it is easy to just use the pre-set blocks, when you want to control things carefully, you sometimes have to biuld it on your own. We worked out together on the whiteboard the exact steps that shooting a bullet would involve:

1. Triggering the action (when clicked)
2. Appearing in the right place (go to and show)
3. Moving to the next place (glide)
4. Detecting contact (touching?)
5. Reacting to the content (send and receive message)

We then converted this into basic blocks. We created the bullet and then a new costume to show the enemy had been shot.

After a false start involving clones, we simplified to one helicopter at first. Here is the final product. THe next step would be to add more helicopters.

Pet Simulator
  : This student decided she wanted to redo the pet simulator project. This was great, cause we realized she didn't quite understand where the location of the costumes was, and how to test when two characters are touching. Once she understood this, she was able to add the cupcake on her own. Apparently, the face doesn't like cupcakes.

Platformer Game
  : She then decided to try her hand at a platformer game. This went swimmingly until she realized she wanted to delete the horde of bad guys she had put there first. Unfortunately in Tynker you have to laboriously delete each character. Not it is much more manageable.

Dance Party
  : Another student decided to work on a dance party. This is pretty straightforward, and a work in progress.
