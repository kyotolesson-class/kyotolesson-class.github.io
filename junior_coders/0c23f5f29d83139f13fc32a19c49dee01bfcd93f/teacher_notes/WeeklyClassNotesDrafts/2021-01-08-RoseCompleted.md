### Recap for January 8th


Kids were very motivated today, and worked hard.

Tutorials
  : Barbie tutorials are a lot of fun. One child worked very hard on a barbie pet tutorial. One challenge she had was understanding repeat blocks. Instead of walking then jumping then walking then jumping then walking then jumping, we can just repeat the walk-jump three times. I used some playing cards to map out the differences, and suddenly, "click", she got it. It's a big step, because loops are, of course, a central concept in coding. 
  
  : The student then went on to create a new project and created  characters. C
  
  : Another student also working through tutorials had some issues using the trackpad on her new computer. Using the trackpad is  probably worth a lesson, and maybe I will spend some time on it next week.

Making characters bigger. 
  : Several students asked about how to make Smaller too.  
  
Birthday card
  : Lastly, one student Lucy made a birthday card for her mom that came out really well. Based on a tutorial project, she changed the background, and the costumes of various characters, including drawing her own birthday present, and recording a birthday song. We also worked together to make the present hop along the bottom of the screen. We used some of the ideas from last class about x and y position to figure out where the present would glide to to make it look like it was jumping. This included working out how many times it would jump to get across the screen, and how to jump back to the other side. Of course, I made a **classic mistake** of forgetting that the x and y position change after each step, so I have to calculate the **relative** position, but the exercise was worth it. Here is the final project:

Here is the code for the jumping birthday present.
