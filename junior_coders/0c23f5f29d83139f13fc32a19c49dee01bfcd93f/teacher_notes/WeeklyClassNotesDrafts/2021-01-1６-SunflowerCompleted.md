### Homework due January 16th


The homework is to continue working on their project and bring one to share next week.

### Recap for January 16th

Exploring
  : Kids were into exploring the blocks we discussed last time on their own today. They all had different ideas, though I noticed they also copied ideas from each other, which is great. 鬼滅の刃 was popular...

Independent discovery
  : Kids were able to discover some things on their own, such as how to use repeat blocks, even though I hadn't taught these yet. Once kids got a hold of an idea, it was interesting to what they did with it, in ways i would never have anticipated.

Sharing
  : Kids really enjoyed sharing projects they were making with the class. By connecting their tablets to the big TV, they could show off their work, practice a little English, and I could help them work out their next direction.   
  
Some topics I helped kids with included:
  : * Making characters move together at the same time. 
  : * Making one character act after another
  : * Making characters bigger or smaller
  : * Erasing a character. 
  : * Using a Bump block for when one character touches another

Sending emails
  : I made a first attempt to show kids how to send their project as an email. This is useful for sharing homework and helping me plan lessons.
  
Keep working
  : When kids finished one project, I gave them another to work on. Some kids were able to complete 2 or three projects.
