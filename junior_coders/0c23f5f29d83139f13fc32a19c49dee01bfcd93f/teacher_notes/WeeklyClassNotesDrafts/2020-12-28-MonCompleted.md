### Homework due January 4th

The homework is to do the tutorial here:

themselves. I have updated it and added a new game. Now, levels 3 through 6 are the ones they should understand and complete. They can also work on their ongoing project.


### Recap for December 28th

Today we talked about two kinds of learning. 

* exploring by yourself 
* learning from others, aka copying


I highlighted the difference, since I was asked, between copying on a test and copying somebody by following their instructions. 

I asked kids if it was hard to find a goal or project to work on, and most said yes. I said that the goal of this class is to learn how to use every block in Tynker. To get started on that goal, we work through the tutorial about basic blocks.

This practical hands-on tutorial is about some easy blocks and how to use them. It includes three games to make.

Control blocks are where games start and change, and we went over the basic ones. Everyone should know these by now.

Using the tutorial, I spend some time talking about the difference between go to and glide blocks.

But probably the most important part was that today I explained about x, y, and positive and negative numbers, which are very important if you need to understand where actors are on the screen. Almost every game needs this, so this understanding is critical to moving ahead. The tutorial tries to get kids to demonstrate their understanding of this by making them move actors to different quadrants, i.e. both x and y positive, or x positive and y negative. 

Then kids finished a platform game that use these ideas. In the game, kids collect coins by moving or gliding the actor to places in different quadrants. This shows that even simple ideas can be very powerful if you use them correctly.

Since there was a lot of explanation involved, I was worried they might not understand, but at this point I could see that they were eager to make the game work and were very excited to see it working and to finish the challenge, capturing all the coins. Even the kids I thought weren't following were able to give me the correct answers! Hooray for them!
