## July 7th 

### Review Project: "Pass It On"

We reviewed homework projects. Students were very kind in giving out "Stars and Wishes", that is talking about what they liked and would improve in each project.


### Switching costumes

Once common challenge in ScratchJr. is making a character suddenly change. We watched a video about [several ways to do that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jv5r9aafZA&feature=youtu.be).

We then walked through a project showing two ways to make a character change costumes using [this project](./scratchProjects/20200706HidingDisappearing.sjr)

1. Using a new screen

If you place the character at the same place in both screens (at the end of one, and the beginning of the other) they will appear toe magically change.

2. Using a message

If you send a message that goes to both characters, you can make one disappear, and the other appear at the same time. 

If you add a 3 "smoke screen" that appears and disappears as the characters change, it can seem like magic.

### The Aliens Have Landed Part 1: *The Space Ship Problem*

We then watched a video describing out next project, "The Aliens Have Landed" from Bootup.

#### Space Ship Problem: Diagonal movement

In the beginning of the video the space ship  moves diagonally up and across the screen. I challenged the group to show me how to do it. Kids came up with some interesting suggestions, and eventually we got to (see Homework). The secret is having both actions take place at the same time in separate "threads".

#### Space Ship Problem: Shrinking Cat

However, in the video, the space ship also gets smaller. How do we do this? One suggestion was made , but the **Red Shrinking Cat** (see screen 2 of Homework) doesn't quite work. This is the homework challenge.

### Hangman

After cleanup we had enough time for a fun game of Hangman. 

### June 29th Homework

* **Solve the Space Ship Problem** (in screens 3 and 4). [Here is a guide for you to download](./scratchProjects/20200706SpaceShipProblemHW.sjr). It has 4 screens:
1. **Diagonal Movement** from class, and a simpler one without loops.
2. **The Red Shrinking Cat** that didn't work. (has loops)
3. Fix this **Red Cat** to make it not bump. Click the box for a hint.
4. An example of how to change direction. Can you make the pig do it too?

* **Extra Credit**: Do you see how I made the hint appear and disappear? Can you copy that somewhere?
* **Extra Credit**: Watch the Aliens have landed video (above) and try to make it (without having the source code). What would you give (of yours!) to an alien?
