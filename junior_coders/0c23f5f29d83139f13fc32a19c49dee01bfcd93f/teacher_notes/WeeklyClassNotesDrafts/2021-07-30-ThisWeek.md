### Recap for July 30


Two ScratchJr. students graduated to Scratch this week. we worked on signing them in, and doing some basic tutorials. As is typical, they became very interested in importing their favorite pictures and chatacters into projects.

Another ScratchJr. student worked on a speed test project. The idea is to see how adding more copies of a block changes the way the block performs, such as going faster. The project is open-ended so as to encourage creativity and exploration.

In Tynker,  Sword fighting project is still very near completion. Student Y ran into a problem that he couldn't tell what his broadcast blocks were doing. I suggested he use more descriptive names for them.

Tynker student R finally completed her Moving Gus Project! It is great!

After that she began exploring for other projects to do next.


Two Tynker students are going on break, and I made a last minute push to finish their projects as much as possible before they left. 

For the Crossy Road project we added a test to see if the main actor was touching the cars, using an "or" conditional. We changed from having the game end when she touches the cars to her going back to the start when she touches the cars. We also added a "You Win" message when she touches the flag. We also added jeep that nudges you move if you take too long. These were some great ideas and the game is a nice success.

For the Mermaid Project, we talked about some options for her game, her modification of the day was to add a score when you catch the good candy, such as the blue candy. This taught her a bit about creating, setting, and changing variables.

### Recap for July 31st

Today we walked through a basic Pacman game. Kids went through it at different paces, with some just completing the first few steps, others nearly reaching the end. However, we will continue with this project as it teaches valuable skills.

This involves

* making the pacman, including 'painting with transparency' 
* making the background and maze
* teaching the pacman to move
* teaching it to bounce off walls
* adding a pill
* initializing the pill and pacman
* teaching the pill to hide when pacman touches it<span>" %}

One notable project was this variation on the classic game:

{% include zakviewer.html Name="Dragon Pacman" ID="https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/557134894/" caption="The dragons are friendly though. Use arrow key to capture the one near the center to see." %}


After that kids worked on their ongoing projects. Kids are developing more confidence and the ability to come up with and develop their own ideas independently, though there is a tendency for kids to also get lost playing games rather than coding. The fact that they are enjoying Scratch and engaged with it is great, and we will try to encourage a healthy balance between exploring and creating!

### Recap for August 2nd

Today we walked through a basic Pacman game. There were only 2 kids today, so it went very smoothly and we make a lot of progress. The kids worked hard straight to the end, with only a short break!

### Recap for August 2nd (Make-up)

Today we had a make-up class where Student R, working mostly on her own, conceived, coded and completed this lovely project. She has clearly come a long way, showing an understanding of different level, animating characcters, sequencing conversations, using "flash screens" and other story framing devices, not to mention concentration, creativity, and attention to detail. Wonderful work!
