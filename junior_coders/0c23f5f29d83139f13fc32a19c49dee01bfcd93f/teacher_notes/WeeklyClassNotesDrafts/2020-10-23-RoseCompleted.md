### October 23rd Class Summary 

Everyone was hard at work on finishing projects in ScratchJr. this week. 

#### What to do when you run out of messages?

One limitation in ScratchJr. is that there are only 6 message colors available per scene. Sometimes however, you want more, which is what happened in one project. The trick to solving it is create a **duplicate scene** that picks up where the old one left off. 

1. create a new scene 
2. copy the background of the previous scene 
3. copy the characters from the last position of the old scene 
4. move them to their last position using the grid 
5. switch to the new scene after the last action in the old scene


#### Other Scratch Limitations 

  1. The canvas is too small

Drawing in the character/background editor is difficult in ScratchJr. One trick that helps is using a two finger gesture to expand and contract the canvas so you can draw in details. 

  2. Copying shapes

Another limitation a student faced today was that the editor can copy shapes, but sometimes the copy ends up too close to the original and they get merged. There is no workaround for this other than redrawing the shape to copy it.


  2. Too many characters

It also turns out that scratchJr. gets very slow when a scene goes on for too long. Another good reason to use the duplicate scene trick.

### Tynker Pattern Maker Tutorial

Another student worked in Tynker, which doesn't have these limitations. She asked for a little help with the Pattern Maker Tutorial that involved drawing shapes like stars and squares.

* Repeat blocks

One requirement of the tutorial is to use repeat blocks. I showed her how to write out all the actions she plans to do to find out which actions have to be repeated and how many times. 

* Geometry and Angles

Using the grid the student has to figure out how far to walk along each edge. She also had to learn how angles work so that the character can turn the right amount. For a square the character turns 90 degrees, but for other shapes the angles is not so easy to guess, so a bit of trial and error was involved. This is good practice. Also, since the available angles were limited, she had to combine several turns to get to the right angle. 

### Plan before you code 

Students tend to want to jump right in on coding once they have an idea, but if an idea is complicated enough they need a little help planning out what is going to happen before trying to code it. This is counterintuitive, so students often need a reminder to take this step. Planning her activity before she coded it also helped her overcome a bit of "coders block" when she was starting out.

### Lots of spelling questions 

In addition to coding, there were a lot of spelling questions this week. The kids seemed to be enjoying learning English as well as coding.
