### Recap for December 18th

Naturally the theme this week was Christmas. We learned how to use google to find good images, this time of a bed fit for a princess. After finding a magnificent example, we learned how to import it into our project, and began our plan out what the story would be.

The other student thought about her story. She had a basic story. This is enough to start with. 

Next time I will try to talk more about planning: 

Who are the characters?
  : Give them names

What do they look like? 
  : Color, shape, size, clothes, and so on

What clothes and expression do they have?
  : Make a rough drawing.

  : Will you use a drawing, the character builder, a photograph?

* What objects are there? 
  : Again, draw them. Even a simple drawing is enough.

* What is the stage or other locations?
  : You will need one stage costume for each

* What happens? How will you show this action?
  : Movement, color, shape, size, sound?

* Who says what, in what order? 
  : When do they say it?

* Who moves and where?
  : When, why? How will show it?
