### My Favorite Things

Student Ak continued working on his favorite things project, finishing a section on Golf.

### Comic Project

Student An finished her comic project and was able to make the character move to the 4th screen. We also talked about the difference between glide and go to blocks.

She plans to adapt the following project next time.

### Saving Trees
Student H was very excited that he had a new idea for a project involving a conversation about the importance of planting trees for global warming. I encouraged him to write his script first before coding and he diligently put together script and chose images to illustrate the conversation. As class closed he began to code it.

{% include turbowarp.html Name="Saving Trees" ID="531547089" caption="" %}


We talked about the difference between using plain say ```say [] ```{: .msb style="display: inline-block; height: 0px;"} and ```say () for () seconds```{: .msb style="display: inline-block; height: 0px;"} blocks. He decided to use the former. We also talked about whether to broadcast ```broadcast ()```{: .msb style="display: inline-block; height: 0px;"} to go between speakers, or to use say and wait ``` wait () seconds ```{: .msb style="display: inline-block; height: 0px;"} blocks. He again decided on the former.
<br><br>
```
when @greenFlag clicked
say [its so hot...] for (3) seconds
wait (4) seconds
say [why do we need to plant more trees !?!?] for (5) seconds
wait (15) seconds
say [yeah right blah blah blah] for (3) seconds
```
{: .msb}


My Explosion

Student M worked on improving his two-player shooting game. We made it so that the bad ships could move 

![Imgur](https://i.imgur.com/w3HZEtk.jpg){: .jsgif}

and that when the ships die they can't shoot any more. This required creating a variable and testing the variable to keep track of whether the actor was alive or not.

I made several suggestions for improvements to the project, but in the end he came up with his own: there will be a heart and if one ship touches the heart the other ship has to hit them more times before they die. We began this by creating another variable. Also, we will make it so you can continue to play after dying.

We will continue working on this next week.

</details>

NOTE* next week, add stop sound and sound explosion to good guy, add set size and stop animation, add repeat until code for bad guy in Miki's project. give him a new starting point.

fix when x < -300 

add health bar
    set local camera actor to stage
on stage 
    add variable health and max health
    set health to 5 and max health to 10
change health when hitting laser (bad guy negative)
we could change name health , but this way we can keep all the standard code.

### Overview for May 15th
All of our kids (in both our classes) were either ready or nearly ready to move to the next level. Yesterday, some kids were doing makeup classes so almost everyone was in the same room. This meant that yesterday was the perfect opportunity to do a group introduction to Scratch (the daddy-app of ScratchJr.) for everyone at the same time. Using Scratch will greatly improve their potential, and eliminate the limitations of ScratchJr. I am very glad we have reached this milestone. 

The first thing most students learn when starting Scratch is how to make a sprite move when you press a key. The first project most kids do is the Animate My Name Project. Some kids worked on other things.





### Importing Characters
Student M worked on importing characters for his project.

{% include turbowarp.html Name="NAME" ID="527529590" caption="Using a google search we imported images into a project." %}

### The Backpack
Student N learned how to use the Scratch "backpack" to copy his favorite sprite from one of his other projects into this project. 

{% include turbowarp.html Name="NAME" ID="530905586" caption="Click the right arrow to move the broom" %}

### Ghost game
More advanced Student R worked on a "Chicken Crossing " type game. 

{% include turbowarp.html Name="NAME" ID="530891031" caption="Use the w key to move the ghost." %}

This project uses the w and s keys to move the ghost.

```
when [w v] key pressed
change y by (10)

when [s v] key pressed
change y by (âˆ’10)

```
{: .msb}


We talked about what should happen when the ghost hits one of the balls. We wanted the character to spin.

```
when I receive [turn ghost v]
turn @turnRight (100000) degrees::motion
```
{: .msb}

This didn't work. Why? The "rotation style" is important, or the character can't spin. We have to explicitly set it to "all around". The game also includes music. This is initialized here.

```
when @greenFlag clicked
set rotation style [all around v]
point in direction (0)
play sound [Jim Yosef & Anna Yvette - Linked [NCS Release] (320 kbps) v] until done
```
{: .msb}

This makes the ghost return to the bottom when he touches the line.
```
when @greenFlag clicked
forever
    if <touching [Line v]?> then
        go to x: (-9) y: (-130)
    end
end
```
{: .msb} 

For the balls, we worked together on making the balls return when they reached the edge. This is also where the balls tell the ghost to spin if he is touched.

```
when @greenFlag clicked
point in direction (-90)
forever
    if <touching [edge v]?> then
        go to x: (215) y: (-119)
    else
        if <touching [Ghost v]?> then
            broadcast [turn ghost v]
        end
    end
    move (5) steps
end
```
{: .msb}



### Moving a Sprite and Using the Fill
Student Y made a simple project to move a sprite.


```
when [right arrow v] key pressed
move (10) steps
```
{: .msb}


{% include turbowarp.html Name="Mover" ID="530904302" caption="Use the arrow keys to move the sprite" %}

### Using the Fill
One difference between Scratch and ScratchJr. is that the fill tool works differently. Student Y encountered the problem that, in ScratchJr., you can fill in partial shapes, but in Scratch you can only fill in closed curves. You can see this in the triangular shape at the bottom of this project.
{% include turbowarp.html Name="Ongoing Project" ID="530889948" caption="The bent line at the bottom has to be filled in by hand. YOu can see this in progress in the solid purple triangle." %}

### Putting the bad candy in a basket 

Student A wanted the bad candy to go into a basket when it was touched. We spent some time debugging this. You can see it in action if you touch the upside down candied Apple at the bottom right.

{% include tynkerprojectpage.html Name="Putting the bad candy in a basket " ID="[ID](https://www.tynker.com/play/mermaid-2/60544ed19136e31635119118-223215XnfCrPFlG.Uzqs7RrvPrrBEk)" caption=" The key block is this. <br>  ![Imgur](https://i.imgur.com/upIX1Qu.png){: .jsgif}" %}

### Clara 

Here we talked about what to do when the character loses lives. We did a simple flowchart of teh if then else on the board. If we have only one life (blank2 costume), then send the you lose message, and then go to the next (zero lives). decrease lives (next costume).

### Yuki developing a new game
Student Y made an "easy training" game for playing shooting games. He made each character have a different strenght and health.

{% include tynkerprojectpage.html Name="NAME" ID="https://www.tynker.com/play/easy-training/609e300ab9de5956dd4d61eb-847165Xgraq9eGT1QsDX3OHJAKJ44k" caption="Use the arrow keys to move the character. Use the a key to shoot. Each actor has a different strength and health." %}

### Soccer Game

Student R made a soccer game. He used bump blocks to control the flow of the game. For example, the two black "field lines" send teh character to the "No Goal!!!" screen. If the ball hits the soccer net, the player goes to the "Goooooool!" screen. 

![Imgur](https://i.imgur.com/ub1RkeM.png){: .jsgif}

Using a yellow message block, when the black button is pushed...

![Imgur](https://i.imgur.com/mp24vC6.png){: .jsgif}
...the ball flies diagonally towards the goal. The player has to choose the right moment.

### Yamato finally finished his maze game
Student really wanted to make a very complicated maze. Unfortunately one limitation in ScratchJr. is that the stage is only 20 by 15 blocks wide. I brought out the graph paper and I outlined a square of half of those dimensions. Each grid square represented 2 blocks, which is wide enough for a character to pass through. we drew the maze within these bounds on paper and then transferred them to the character.
![Imgur](https://i.imgur.com/qLmkiqU.png){: .jsgif}

Then he began making the maze game itself using buttons and message blocks to control the sprite. When finished the sprite will get a you won message if they complete the maze. Also, if the sprite touches the maze he will be sent back to the start.

### Disappearing Characters
Students K and R did a makeup class on Saturday, where we held an **introduction to Scratch** class. They worked together on a project inspired by the **Animate My Name** Tutorial.  When game starts, some characters are shown, others are hidden.

```
when gf clicked
show

when gf clicked
hide
```
{: .msb style="width:10%;"}

When the Stage is clicked, the backdrop changes and a message is sent. Some letters appear and some letters disappear. Next week, they will make the first name reappear.

```
event_whenstageclicked
switch backdrop to (1 v) ::looks
broadcast (change v)

when i receive [change v]
hide

when i receive [change v]
show
```
{: .msb}

{% include turbowarp.html Name="Disappearing Names" ID="530893183" caption="Next week they will make the letters reappear." %}
