### Recap for July 19th

Today we started off with a series of tests ([test 1](https://scratch.mit.edu/studios/30066443), [test 2](https://scratch.mit.edu/studios/30066443), [test 3](https://scratch.mit.edu/studios/30066443))based on the recent Mario galaxy 4 projects. Students were given a set of blocks and instructions to turn those blocks into particular actions. For example, these blocks

were used to make the actor go up and down and touch the donut:

The first test was pretty easy, but the last one required some thinking. I was pleased that they were all able to complete it, with a little help.

After that, kids continued their own projects and tutorials. I also showed them this video sensing project, which inspired at least one kid to develop his own version, which kids enjoyed.

We closed the day with a new game, ["Hackenbush"](http://www.papg.com/show?1TMP=). In addition to being fun, it helps teaches about thinking ahead and basic logic.

### Reminder 
### Recap for July 16th

ScratchJr.
  : This week we had a student visiting us, which gave an opportunity for kids to show off some of their projects to him, as well as to teach him the basics of ScratchJr.

  THe most popular of the games they worked with was the mario project from a few weeks ago. The student needed some help explaining how to make the characters disappear.

Sword Fight
  : The Sword Fight project is effectively finished. The student added a bronze match, and then a final goodbye and thank you for all the characters.  We discussed future projects, including a fainting project and a Harry Potter Project.

Move Gus 
  : The Move Gus project is also nearing completion. The student what is planned to be the last level, with the final battle. We talked about how the project would go from here and she began coding it.

Mermaid
  : This week we added a flashing "Good Job" when the character gets the good candy. I explained how we would make it flash.

### Recap for July 17th

Today kids worked on their own projects.

Student Y started a shooting game. He began to learn how to make bullets using clones, and how to make actors disappear when they are hit.

Student N began a version of pacman. He made little munching characters, and we worked on drawing a maze for the background. We also made the main actor move right and left, and then blocked its motion when it reached the edge so it wouldn't fall of the edge.

Student M learned how to change the position of the actors using the x and y boxes in the actor area. This was necessary because he couldn't drag his characters because part of his game codes them to disappear if touched. 


Student R started planning a Minecraft quiz game. We talked about learning to plan on paper before trying to code, which he began to do. I also helped him import some images from the web that couldn't be copied the usual way. 



Student H worked on importing characters from other projects into his project.

Kids also enjoyed coding and playing at a video project;

and a Jelly project. I showed them a simplified version, and perhaps next week we will try to code it together.
