## November 13th

### Homework due November 20th

Play in Tynker and get used to the interface. 

### Recap for November 13th
Today we worked on a final ScratchJr. project. We made a basic video game, that involved the idea of a hero, and obstacle, and a collision. These concepts will help us in Tynker.

The project was very simple: 

* A moving obstacle and code for its movement. At first the character just moved in one direction, but then we added crazy movements. This is the fun part of the project. 
* A main character the player controls
* Buttons to control the main character. As above we made the movements a bit crazy and unpredictable.
* Code to say what happens when character and obstacle collide, like playing a sound. What kind of game it is depends on this. Maybe the goal is to hit the obstacle, or maybe it is to avoid the obstacle.

The kids went through it like pros! 

Then we moved onto Tynker as a class. My main goal was to give an overview of the interface (the UX). The key point was to get everyone to find the classroom page so they could see the tutorials and class assignments. We also covered how to:

* Open a project
* Give a project a name
* Change a character's appearance
* Share a project in the stream. 

This was a quick overview, but this will become second nature soon enough.
