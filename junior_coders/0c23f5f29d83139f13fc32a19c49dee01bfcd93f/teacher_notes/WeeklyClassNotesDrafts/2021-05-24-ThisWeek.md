### Recap for May 21st


Candy Project
  : Student A asked how to make the bad candy look like it is IN the basket. The trick is to use a tool like pixlr to cut the basket into a front and back part. We put the front basket in different layers. Then we can put the item between the two layers. I have created the basket pieces for her, and next week we will work on the code.

Jumping Game
  : I showed them a math game (a simplified clone of a popular app). She was inspired by this to create a storyboard for her own her own jumping game. She began creating the characters and next week we will make the magic happen.



Android Chase
  : She started a project where two androids will chase a heroine. She was able to code the keyboard movements for the main actor.

Mario Projects
  : Some students finished their maze projects and were able to make a first stab at the Mario project. Most were were able to make the opening screens and first screen, but some had problems making Mario jump over the gap in the third screen. Next week we will improve their jumps, and make them collect coins.

  : * The first two screens work, but the jump in the last screen is still not high enough.

Sword Fighting
  : Student Y came up with an idea for his next project, a story of a sword fighting tournament. We talked about the project and he completed his script and storyboard in clas, and started creating his actors.

### Recap for May 22nd

Castle and Dragons
  : Student H came up with a project based on the castle and dragons app. He was able to get some sprites and we discussed how to make it so when you press the opening screen the rocket shoots up. This involves message blocks:

```
when this sprite clicked
broadcast [message1 v]  
```
{: .msb}

```
when I receive [message1 v]
point in direction (0)
repeat (100)
    move (1) steps
end
```
{: .msb}

We also had a problem that the rocket he had was in the wrong direction,s o it has to be rotated so it would be looking up when we go up. This is what it will look like.

Kimetsu No Yaiba Race 
  : Student M worked on a project where there is a race between sprites. First we created a repeat loop that moves the character from the start to the finish. Then we put this in a forever loop to keep the race going. Next week we will create a finish line that will stop the race.

```
when @greenFlag clicked
forever
    go to x: (-189) y: (-89)
    repeat (45)
        move (10) steps
    end
end
```
{: .msb}

{: .msb}


Cat Flying
  : Student N worked on making this cat flying tutorial. First he created a loop to make the building go from one side to the next. Then we added speed variable and we controlled the variable using keyboard inputs. 

```
when @greenFlag clicked
set [speed v] to [-10]
forever
    show
    set x to (250)
    repeat (50)
        change x by (speed)
    end
    hide
end

when [s v] key pressed
set [speed v] to [-20]

when [a v] key pressed
set [speed v] to [-5]

```
{: .msb}

Flying Bird
  : Student Y worked on some tutorials, including one to make this bird fly and speak.
{% include turbowarp.html Name="Flying Bird" ID="534417112" caption="Click the left and right arrows to make it move" %}

He is currently working on a Pong game.

### Recap for May 24th


My Favorite Things
  : Student A has finished the first round of his "My Favorite Things" project. After looking at it, I suggested some improvements, especially to have more things happen during the presentation times.

Pinball and using **When** blocks
  : Student A did the Pinball game tutorial. The project is a little advanced, but she was able to complete it. The main tool was using **When** blocks that perform actions at the right moment.

  : * The touching , set viewport, and apply impulse blocks are used to send the ball flying.

  : * Each award or bumper or actor has a different actions attached to it that ball collides with it, it reacts.

Environment Video
  Student H added sound and visual effects to enhance the dialogue.

My Explosion Game
  : Student M added a new feature: when the player touches the heart, the other player needs to hit him more times before he can do the kill shot.

![Imgur](https://i.imgur.com/HXZPYXx.png){: .jsgif}
  : * The if loop test if the number of hits the other player needs to shoot is 1 before causing the explosion.
