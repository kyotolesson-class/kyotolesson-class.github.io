### Recap for February 5th

#### February 5th Tynker

Tutorials
  : One student started out on tutorials but then decided to try the cake decorating project. In the project there are various kinds of icing we can put on a cake. We walked through the code step by step together for the first few types of icing. She was very focused and learned a lot. By the time we were done she was able to code new icing by herself and her homework is to finish the project.

Fruit Frog
  : One student spent her time exploring various projects tutorials. Some of them needed explanation and I sat with her to show her what was involved. One of the projects she did was "Fruit Frog" where a frog prince eats fruit with its tongue. She changed the frog to a lizard, but had to add some code to make the lizard show up and be the right size.

"walking guy" Game
  : One student continued working on her "walking guy" Game. She needed a little help figuring out how to add a new character. She really enjoyed trying to make the fairy escape from all the villains.
  
#### February 5th ScratchJr. 

Race to the Finish
  : Today's ScratchJr. project was a variation of the race to the finish project. This served as a gentle introduction to using messages and making buttons. They both make a lot of progress but had a bit to finish for homework.
