### September 18 Homework 

The homework for next week is to continue the Knock Knock Joke Project, by adding the joke below. Notice the *matching colors* of the [**Send and Receive Blocks**{: style="color: darkgreen;background-color: yellow"}]. The Receiving block has to match the color of the Sending block before it. Making these colors **match** is the main point of the exercise.


A: [**Green Flag**{: style="color: darkgreen;background-color: yellow"}] Knock Knock [**Send ORANGE**{: style="color: orange;background-color: yellow"}]
<br>B: [**Receive ORANGE**{: style="color: orange;background-color: yellow"}] Who's there? [**Send BLUE**{: style="color: blue;background-color: yellow"}]

A: [**Receive BLUE**{: style="color: blue;background-color: yellow"}] Ice Cream soda [**Send GREEN**{: style="color: green;background-color: yellow"}]
<br>B: [**Receive GREEN**{: style="color: green;background-color: yellow"}] Ice Cream soda who? [**Send PURPLE**{: style="color: purple;background-color: yellow"}]

A: [**Receive PURPLE**{: style="color: purple;background-color: yellow"}] Ice Cream so the other people can hear me. 
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;= *(I scream so the other people can hear me.)*





### Sending Messages by Making a Conversation

The main topic today was how to send a message and receive a message to start a conversation.

-   First, Fairy says something and then [**Sends**{: style="color: orange;background-color: yellow"}] (an orange) message

![Fairy Sends Message](images/2020-04-20/sendMessageFromFairy.jpg "Fairy Sends Message")

-   The Frog [**Receives**{: style="color: orange;background-color: yellow"}] it (**SAME COLOR**) and responds

![Frog Receives Message](images/2020-04-20/FrogReceivesMessageAndResponds.jpg "Frog Receives Message")

Key Point:
: The **color**  of the [**Receive**{: style="color: orange;background-color: yellow"}] on the Frog matches the color of the [**Send**{: style="color: orange;background-color: yellow"}] before it on the Fairy.

### Continue the conversation

We also talked about how to make a longer conversation:

1. As before, the Fairy starts (speaks and sends ORANGE message. You need to connect it!)
   ![Um Froggie](images/2020-04-20/umFroggie.jpg "Um Froggie")
1. Froggie replies
   ![alt-text](images/2020-04-20/yesFairy.jpg "Hover text")
1. Then Sends a New RED Message (remember to connect it!)
   ![alt-text](images/2020-04-20/sendRedMessage.jpg "Hover text")
1. Fairy receives the **red** message. Says something. Then she continues by sending a YELLOW message back to Froggie (connect it).
   ![alt-text](images/2020-04-20/thisIsNotAForest.jpg "Hover text")
1. What color message does Froggie Receive?

### The KEYS to Messages

-   Each message has 2 parts, sending and receiving.
-   They have to be the SAME color! (did I mention that?)
-   One character sends. The other receives, and acts.
-   They can send a new message back....

#### Knock Knock Joke Project

We made a Knock knock Joke project. The joke is below. Notice the color of the [**Send and Receive Blocks**{: style="color: darkgreen;background-color: yellow"}]. 

A: [**Green Flag**{: style="color: darkgreen;background-color: yellow"}] Knock Knock [**Send ORANGE**{: style="color: orange;background-color: yellow"}]
<br>B: [**Receive ORANGE**{: style="color: orange;background-color: yellow"}] Who's there? [**Send BLUE**{: style="color: blue;background-color: yellow"}]

A: [**Receive BLUE**{: style="color: blue;background-color: yellow"}] Wooden Shoe [**Send GREEN**{: style="color: green;background-color: yellow"}]
<br>B: [**Receive GREEN**{: style="color: green;background-color: yellow"}] Wooden Shoe who? [**Send PURPLE**{: style="color: purple;background-color: yellow"}]

A: [**Receive PURPLE**{: style="color: purple;background-color: yellow"}] Wooden Shoe like me to tell you another joke? 
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;= *(Wouldn't you like me to tell you another joke?.)*
