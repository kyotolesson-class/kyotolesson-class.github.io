### Recap for February 20th


ScratchJr.
  :Today in ScratchJr. we talked about the story of the 3 little pigs, which everyone seemed to know and enjoy telling me. Then I showed the kids this the the 3 little pigs project, which was derived from a student project done last year.

This involves all the skills we have been working on so far, especially sending messages and all the movement and control blocks.

Project of the day
  : The project of the day was to tell a story, either a well-known one, or one you make up. Naturally some kdis were interested in make Kimetsu no Yaiba stories, but they also made other stories, for example, this story is about a bear. He uses a time machine to go back in time 24 hours, but his time machine leaves him, so in the end he has to way a day for it to come back. The clever bit is that the story then repeats itself forever!
