## November 30th

### Homework due December 6th

Individual Homeworks. Keep working on projects.

### Recap for November 30th

Today most of the kids chose to start new projects. First kids worked on planning new projects. We ended up with a variety of types. We had a (not-so-simple) simple story, a shooting game, some platform games, and some character design play.

#### Group Photo Shoot 

The highlight of the class was a group photo shoot. As a team we all got together and took pictures of a lego boy which one student wanted to use as a character. Today I removed the backgrounds using pixlr, and so they are ready to be used as Actor costumes!

Next week we will work on incorporating these into the shooting game!
