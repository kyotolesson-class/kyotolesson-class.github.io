    ## May 11th ### May 4th Homework Review I will send emails with more detailed comments individually later. ### Main Idea: Control Buttons **Control Buttons** were the main idea of this class. Control buttons make one character control another character.
    **Screen 1** of the [3-Button-Race and Follow The Maze Sample Projects](./scratchProjects/3ButtonRaceFollowTheMazeHW.sjr) gives an example. It also has a simple exercise for you to do if you think you need more **practice**. Making a control is a
    2 step process. Here is what to do: 1. Make the button. It can be anything. * When you touch the CONTROLLER it sends a message. Add this: ![Monkey Controls Frog](./images/2020-05-11/ControlButtonsMonkeySendsGreen.jpg "Monkey Controls Frog") 2. Go
    to the character that receives that message. * When THE CONTROLLED gets the message, it acts. Add this: ![Frog is controlled by Monkey](./images/2020-05-11/ControlButtonsFrogisControlled.jpg "Frog is controlled by Monkey") That's it!!! In my example,
    **Monkey** controls **Frog**, and **Penguin** controls Cat. If you need **practice**, try to make the **Flag** control **Tac**. ### Using Controls: Race to the Finish To get some practice with **Control Buttons** we worked with [my version of the
    Race to the Finish Project](./scratchProjects/20200511DavidRace2FinishGame.sjr) from BootUp. (*I recommend you download it if you have questions about what we did.*) Notice how similar it is to the Hare and Tortoise homework. #### Part One of The
    Race to the Finish. Students had to try to copy **Screen 1**. This is just like Hare and Tortoise: ![Screen 1 of Race to the Finish](./scratchProjects/Images/Y1R25RaceToTheFinish/Story/Y1R25RacetotheFinish.gif "Screen 1 of Race to the Finish") ####
    Part Two of The Race to the Finish: The Game In class, we then made this into a game. Look at **Screen 2**. It has 2 controls. The CAT BUTTON controls the **Cat**, the BIRD BUTTON controls the **Bird**. Could you do it? Look at it again and fix it
    if you have to. ![Screen 2 of Race to the Finish](./scratchProjects/Images/Y1R25RaceToTheFinish/Game/Y1R25RacetotheFinishGame.gif "Screen 2 of Race to the Finish") Notice that when I click the green boxes, the characters move to the right one step.
    Tap the buttons together with a friend and see who can win the race. We then made a crazy version on **Screen 3**. ### Preview for May 18th: Follow the Maze Project In the next class, we will make 4 controls for one character. Download and see **Screen
    2** of the [3-Button-Race and Follow The Maze Sample Projects](./scratchProjects/3ButtonRaceFollowTheMazeHW.sjr). They will make the character move up, down, right, and left. Here is a picture of the finished game. Can you figure out how it works?
    ![Follow the maze Game](./images/2020-05-11/FollowTheMazeGame.gif "Follow the maze Game") It has an extra twist at the end. Can you figure out how the **Cake** appears? *Hint: It uses a hidden control.* * I made one **Arrow**. Then I copied it and
    rotated it to make the other 3. Here is the **Left Arrow**: ![Making an Arrow Control](./images/2020-05-11/MakingAnArrowControl.gif) * Then I added code for each arrow. Here is the code for the **Up Arrow** * Arrow: yellow touch trigger, send message
    * Cat: get message, do action ![Making the Up Button](./images/2020-05-11/UpButtonWorks.gif) ### May 11th Homework: Finish the Follow the Maze **Screen 2** has 4 Arrow Controls. The **Up Arrow** works like above, but your Homework is to make the other
    **Arrows** work. 1. Use different color messages 2. Make the controls a little smaller 3. Change the Maze (in the background)!! * Use this kind of maze if you want it simple. See the dots in the middle of the squares? ![Easy Maze](./images/2020-05-11/EasyMaze.jpg)
    * **Useful Tip**: When you adjust the dots/lines for your maze, make the dots in the **CENTER** of the light grey grid squares, **NOT on the lines** of the grid squares. * YES: ![Dots go in the center](./images/2020-05-11/DotsInTheCenter.jpg){: width="100px"}
    * No: ![Dots go in the center](./images/2020-05-11/DotsNotLikeThis.jpg){: width="100px"} Now you have a **Follow the Maze Game**! Easy Peasy! ### May 11th Zoom Issues Apologies if you had problems getting my attention after I muted everyone. I was
    trying to control background noise by muting everyone and turning people back on. It wasn't so successful. Sorry. It is difficult to keep background noise down. If you are having a side conversation or you have background noise in your house, it is
    helpful to mute your microphone so others don't hear it. Then, if you want to speak or turn it back on again. Sometimes I am paying attention to one student, and the part of my screen that shows students or incoming chats may not be easy for me to
    see. Please keep trying. This is just a limitation of doing remote classes. Thanks for being patient! Gambare!

    ## May 4th ### Animate My name I had students make their own project based on the [Bootup Animate My Name](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQzWGY4xuSY) project, which you can [download here](https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B342uiaCLSS3YzJTUmlha1FQRjF1cldPdjQtUVhGUjFROEFz)
    [^downloadingprojects]. Students created characters based on the letters in their name. We talked about what each letter was doing. Then students created their own. As a follow, we changed it so instead of all the characters moving at once, they moved
    in turn. Some kids got creative and had the letters say things and do funny things along the way. ### Student Homework Notes I went over last week's homework with the students. I gave each student some next steps to keep working on. The most common
    thing was to make the conversations longer and go back and forth. ### Homework Part 1: Keep working on Alien Planet Continue adding and revising Alien Planet. Think about: - Make the characters talk to each other. Try to turn it into a story. - Make
    the character's actions meaningful. ### Homework Part 2: A Story Based on the Hare and Tortoise

    <!-- ![](https://kyoto-lesson.github.io/junior_coders/monday_pm/images/2020-05-04/Homeworkfor05-11.gif) -->

    ![](images/2020-05-04/Homeworkfor05-11.gif) #### Instructions - The goal is to create a similar project by yourself. - You can download the [movie here](./images/2020-05-04/Homeworkfor05-11.gif). It is just an example. - You can use regular scratch backgrounds,
    or make your own. - Choose any characters, or **make your own**. - I have made a sample "screenplay" (below), but **you can use your own**. - Use messages to make the characters speak **in turn**. - Control the speed of the characters. - You can make
    the characters walk in funny ways. - My horse is in the tree. Where do you think the characters should be placed? #### Sample Screenplay 1. Character2 and the Character1 introduce themselves and decide to have a race 1. Background: the entrance to
    the race 2. Characters: Character1, Character2, Character3 3. Script: - Character1: You are slow. I am the fastest. - Character2: Actually, I am faster than you. Let's race! - Character1: Yeah? Okay, let's race. - Character3: I will be the judge.
    When I say, go, start running. - Character3: Ready...Steady....Go - _Character2 runs slowly, and the Character1 runs quickly off the screen. When he does he disappears we go to the next screen._ In class we will continue this story. Any ideas?

    ## April 27th ### Skills Review We did a [guided walkthough][] of the [skills review sample project][] [^downloadingprojects] using the [skills we should all know at this stage][]. Can you do them all? You have learned a lot already!!! [guided walkthough]:
    ../lessons/20200427SkillsTest.html [skills we should all know at this stage]: #addendum-skill-review-checklist [skills review sample project]: ./scratchProjects/Project120200427SkillsTest.sjr [^downloadingprojects]: **Downloading projects**: If you
    have any difficulty opening projects in Scratchjr, please note two things. 1) Scratchjr must be open when you open the sjr file. 2) You must have the latest version installed. If you still have problems let us know. ### Teacher Says with Zoom I talked
    about the game [Zoom version of the Teacher Says game](../lessons/TeacherSays.html), which we played once before. In this version, I walked through the project and students sent reactions, either 1 👍 or 2 👏, showing which button does **the next
    action**. Everyone did great using the zoom reaction buttons. Just using your hands was okay too. ### Alien Planet I showed everyone the [Alien Planet Project](./scratchProjects/Y1R31Alienplanet.sjr). I gave students an assignment modelled on the
    Alien Planet ([see addendum](#addendum-alien-planet-project-assignment)) . See [this addendum](#addendum-code-for-alien-planet) for the code. ### How to send projects When you are done, you can [email it to me](mailto:teacher@kyotolesson.com) from
    the scratch project page. See the [addendum on sending projects](#addendum-sending-projects) for a How-to. ### Update Scratchjr Scratchjr just updated their program[^whywecantdownloadit]. I suggest you update it on your device, here: - <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/scratchjr/id895485086?ls=1&amp;mt=8">App Store</a>    - <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.scratchjr.android">Google Play</a> - <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/scratchjr/oipimoeophamdcmjcfameoojlbhbgjda">Chrome Web Store</a> - <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01AKGTD2E">Amazon</a>    ### April 27 Homework Keep working on [The Alien Planet assignment](#addendum-alien-planet-project-assignment).

        </summary>

        #### Addendum: Alien Planet Project Assignment 1. Create your own background like the one in the project. It can be anything you like, but at least: - [ ] draw several lines - [ ] use the fill tool to fill in areas. 2. Create at least 3 and up to 8 characters.
        For each one: - [ ] Edit the character to make them alien. - [ ] Add fills, strokes, and whatever else you want. - [ ] Size and place the character at their start point 3. Each character can have more than one green flag or other **trigger** at
        the same time. See [Alien Bat](#slide-03). 4. Make each character do one or more things with the **start trigger** and the **touch trigger** and the **bump trigger**. Here are some choices: - [ ] Make the character move and dance. Use all the
        blue blocks. - [ ] Include sounds and speech bubbles for the characters and have the character make the sound, either at the beginning or when touched, or any other time. - [ ] Use repeat/loop (yellow) and repeat forever (red) blocks. See the
        Alien Cat for an example of both. - [ ] Change the speed of the character - [ ] Have the character become invisible and visible. See [Alien Bat](#slide-03). - [ ] Have the characters talk to each other. This project has no example, but we have
        covered it before. Here is an easy example of a [simple conversation](./scratchProjects/card08-greet.pdf)

    ## April 20th ### Sending Messages by Making a Conversation The main topic today was how to send a message and receive a message to start a conversation. - First, Fairy says something and **then** sends (ORANGE) message ![Fairy Sends Message](images/2020-04-20/sendMessageFromFairy.jpg
    "Fairy Sends Message") - The Frog receives it and responds ![Frog Receives Message](images/2020-04-20/FrogReceivesMessageAndResponds.jpg "Frog Receives Message") ### Continue the conversation We also talked about how to make a longer conversation:
    1. Fairy Starts (speaks and sends ORANGE message. You need to connect it!) ![Um Froggie](images/2020-04-20/umFroggie.jpg "Um Froggie") 1. Froggie replies ![alt-text](images/2020-04-20/yesFairy.jpg "Hover text") 1. Then Sends a New RED Message (remember
    to connect it!) ![alt-text](images/2020-04-20/sendRedMessage.jpg "Hover text") 1. Fairy receives the red message. Says something. Then she continues by sending a YELLOW message back to Froggie (connect it). ![alt-text](images/2020-04-20/thisIsNotAForest.jpg
    "Hover text") ### The KEYS to Messages - Each message has 2 parts, sending and receiving. - One character sends. The other receives, and acts. - They can send a new message back.... #### Advanced Keys - One character can send more than one message,
    for example to different characters, or the same character. - The same message can go to more than one character, too. That is, more than one character can receive the message when it is sent. - Sometimes you even send messages to yourself! See [Dragon
    Maze Part 2](../lessons/DragonMazePart2.html) for examples. ### April 20 Homework The homework was to make a longer conversation by sending several messages back and forth between characters as above. If you need something for the characters to say,
    [here are some jokes](../lessons/JokesForBadJokes.html) to use. ### Going to a different Screen We also talked about adding new Screens/Pages to a Project: 1. Create a new Screen ![alt-text](images/2020-04-20/NewScreen.jpg "Hover text") 2. Go back
    to 1st Screen 3. The screen appears in the (red) buttons ![screen appears](images/2020-04-20/ScreenVisible.jpg "screen appears") 4. Add it to the actions ![screen appears](images/2020-04-20/GoToScreen.jpg "screen appears") ### The Dragon Maze almost
    solved Some students worked very hard on the Dragon Maze, but they had a problem. I have made special [Dragon Maze Part 2](../lessons/DragonMazePart2.html) directions on making the Dragon maze work. It uses sending messages. The directions are very
    detailed, so take it slow. If you have questions, we will go over it in class next week. ### Zoom problems We had some difficulty because Zoom cut off the meeting at a certain point. Zoom told us this would not happen, so we didn't expect it. Sorry
    about that. It will be fixed next week. If it DOES happens again sometime, please just wait a few seconds and use the Zoom link again. I will start the call again and wait for people to join again, like we did this time. As above, this should not
    be a problem next week. #### Following the Conversation Remember that other people can hear what you are saying at home. If you need to have a side conversation, feel free to mute your microphone temporarily. Sometimes I am focused on one or other
    students. You may want to listen, as it may answer questions you have too. Or you can wait by working on your own project while I take care of them. Try to think about what your next question will be. If you don't know what to do, speak up or send
    me a chat message. Sometimes I will need to mute you to make it easier for everyone to hear the conversation. You may get a message in Zoom asking for permission, that you will need to respond to. #### Sharing Screens Everyone seems to be able to
    share screens finally. I know it is a little tricky, but it is part of doing class remotely. Sharing the screen is important for me so I can see your progress and offer help, so thank you for cooperating and bearing with it! Talking via Zoom is more
    difficult than regular conversation, but if we try we can find ways to make it easier and better. ### Next Class: Review The next class will be mostly a review and testing class. I expect a lot of back and forth, so be ready to talk! I also hope to
    do some activities as a group. Can you use all of the skills we have used so far? - [ ] Choosing and changing the background - [ ] adding and changing lines and shapes - [ ] adding and making characters bigger or smaller - [ ] making characters visible
    or invisible - [ ] making characters move in different ways - [ ] making characters act at the start, or when they are touched - [ ] making characters speak and make sounds - [ ] sending and receiving messages - [ ] moving to different screens/pages
    You have learned a lot I hope!!! You can use this class to catch up on things you have missed, and if you feel advanced, you can get more practice, and I will also ask you to help other students, so be ready to explain what you know! ### Feedback
    I always welcome feedback, about anything in the class. I look forward to seeing everyone in person as soon as it is safe to do so!! :-)

    ## April 13th ### Using Zoom See [Topic: Using Zoom](../lessons/usingZoom.html) ### Game: Black See [Topic: Game: Black](../lessons/gameBlack.html) ### ScratchJr: Messages #### Making the maze _Skill: Modifying a path in the background_ We went over how
    to use the select arrow to modify the path of a line in the background. ![the path of a line in the background](./images/2020-04-13/Screen%20Shot%202020-04-14%20at%2011.30.36%20AM.png){:height="200px"} Children made a maze, where the character walks
    on the line, as in Black. Then they added a dragon and a cake. ![maze with dragon and cake](./images/2020-04-13/Screen%20Shot%202020-04-14%20at%2011.41.19%20AM.png){:height="200px"} They made their character walk the maze and try to eat the [dragon](hjh).
    [![Tic walks to dragon](./images/2020-04-13/Screen%20Shot%202020-04-14%20at%2011.44.42%20AM.png){:height="59px"}](./images/2020-04-13/Screen%20Shot%202020-04-14%20at%2011.44.42%20AM.png) #### Tic Is Trapped! _Skill: Sending Messages_ But the dragon
    sends a message: ![the dragon sends a message](./images/2020-04-13/Screen%20Shot%202020-04-14%20at%2011.47.13%20AM.png){:height="59px"} and Tic is sent home: ![Tic is sent home](./images/2020-04-13/Screen%20Shot%202020-04-14%20at%2011.47.25%20AM.png){:height="59px"}
    ### Disappearing Dragons _Skill: Making Characters Disappear_ Tic goes to get the cake first. The cake makes the dragon disappear. - Cake sends a message. ![Cake sends a message](./images/2020-04-13/Screen%20Shot%202020-04-14%20at%2011.58.43%20AM.png){:height="59px"}
    - Dragon gets the message. ![Dragon gets the message](./images/2020-04-13/Screen%20Shot%202020-04-14%20at%2011.58.51%20AM.png){:height="59px"} ### April 13 Homework The homework is to play with Zoom and the Maze. Practice: - _Skill: Modifying a path
    in the background_ - _Skill: Sending Messages_ - _Skill: Making Characters Disappear_ We will use these in our next lesson: Bad Jokes! ![Bad](./images/2020-04-13/Screen%20Shot%202020-04-14%20at%2012.48.59%20PM.png)

    ## April 6th Class Outline & homework: [Topic; Prep for Disappearing Dragon](../lessons/jc_a_003.html) ### Postponing the Homework Because this class was partially a remote class, I wasn't able to fully cover the material needed for the homework, so I
    suggest students **postpone** the homework I assigned this time. Instead, Parents should install [Zoom](https://zoom.us/) on their device and if possible spend some time familiarizing themselves and their child with how to use it. This should include
    creating an account email and password. This way we can be ready for a remote class as early as next week. ### Discord to Zoom Because of concerns about the Corona Virus this class was a combination of student's participating in person and via a Discord
    session. Though it was the first time doing a remote class, and as a result of patience and cooperation of students and families, I think we were able to have a successful class. However, we did notice some areas where it could be improved, and have
    discovered that [Zoom](https://zoom.us/) will be able to provide us and students with a better experience. Next class we will start using Zoom. ### Dragon Maze Demo First, I demonstrated a ScratchJr project demonstrating a character eating a cake
    in order to make a dragon disappear and being able to exit a maze. The purpose was to show how to use Action Blocks for making characters visible or invisible, sending messages, or initiating actions on Bumps. The rest of the class was a detailed
    and progressive practice in using each of these blocks by creating 4 characters who used these actions [in various ways](./../lessons/jc_a_003.md). While somewhat silly and arbitrary, the exercise was intended to help the children get ample practice
    using the blocks, as well as beginning to understand programing logic and sequencing. For reference I have put the details . With these blocks described [here](./../lessons/jc_a_003.html) we have all we need to create the Disappearing Dragon Maze,
    which we will begin next week.
