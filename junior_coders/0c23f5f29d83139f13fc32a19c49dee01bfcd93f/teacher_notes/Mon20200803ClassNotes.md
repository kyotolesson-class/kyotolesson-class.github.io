## July 3rd Homework Review 



We reviewed Flying Project Homework. Some kids used the same background, but some chose a night scene or other scene. Most kids were able to create the first screen with ease, so we moved on to how to create the cool "rising into the sky" effect. 

First we tried it with the kids just looking at the result and trying to code it without any help. Then I helped overcome problems, and gave suggestions on how to improve it.

The transition involves several steps:

1. The airplane is touched and it rises to the top of the screen and disappears. 

2. The second screen appears. This image is the continuation of the screen below it. this creates the effect of rising into the sky.

3. To make the effect clearer, the top of the trees in screen one are added to teh bottom of screen two. 

4. When we get to screen 2, these trees go down, making it look like we are rising into the sky above the trees.

5. The effect is better when the trees go down slowly, and disappear at different times. 

6. We spent a lot of time figuring out how to draw clouds using circles. Drawing a circle with a border covered by a circle without creates the cloud shape in the project.

7. I also discussed how to make small stars by drawing a small line with just two dots and bringing the dots just over each other.



### July 3rd Homework

Now that we know how to make the "rising up" effect, you can finish making the Flying Project. That is the homework. Can you make the the plane fly up in screens 1, 2, 3, and then back down using screens 3, 4, 1?

#### Next Week

make a project that uses this transition very cleanly:

the items in screen one go down and the next screen picks up at teh same place.

and so on in a cycle.

Do the same going right.
