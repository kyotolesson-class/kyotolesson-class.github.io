### Recap for January 30th

Sharing Time
  : At the beginning of class I try to have a sharing time when kids can share their projects, especially their homework. All the kids worked on their homework and when they were ready we shared the results. I challenged kids to say one thing they liked about the project, and give one suggestions. This was only mildly successful as kids really wanted to work on their projects.

Project of the day
  : Today's goal was to work with the bump block. I introduced the project of the day called Animate Your Name. Kids make characters from their name or a word, and then make the characters jump in various ways when the program starts. The second part was to make the characters do even more actions when they are touched. Kids were very creative and as usual, Kimetsu no Aiba was a running theme. Kids continued to work on projects they had been working on.

Message Block
  : I also introduced the message block. This will take a while to sink in, but I tried to introduce the Knock Knock Joke project, but it seemed that kids couldn't quite get how they work. Next week I will show them this project and bring in some more jokes to see if they can learn to make conversations. 

Making a Kimetsu no Aiba Character
  : I had each kids teach me how to make a Kimetsu no Aiba character. Then we used these characters to make a conversation using the characters.

Hangman and JellyFish
  : At one point the class was a bit unruly, so to bring us all together by doing the Jellyfish song. It was a lot of fun. At the end, we played Hangman as usual. Kids really enjoyed this.
