### Recap for February 19th

ScratchJr.
  :Today in ScratchJr. we worked on the the 3 little pigs story. This involves all the skills we have been working on so far, especially sending messages and all the movement and control blocks.

I showed the kids the sample project, which was derived from a student project done last year.

After a brief explanation, one student turned this out, with barely any help from me.

Impressive job!

The second part of the project was to retell any well-known story. One child asked how to make it appear as if a character were walking, and I showed her a simple trick of moving the background instead of the character to give the appearance of movement:

Tynker
  : In Tynker one student continued a whirlwind tour of sample projects. She spent some time working with the characters in the Animation Board project, but it was a bit difficult, so she settled on the Underwater Arcade.

In this project, her challenge was to make the fish move down. Unfortunately she had put the loop in the wrong place

but after some work she was able to debug it.
