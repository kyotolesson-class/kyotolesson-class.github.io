### Recap for March 5th


ScratchJr.
  : We continued working on the Beach Game project, and i introduced a new Sword Game.

For the beach project, one student made a project around finding a starfish. She had an opening screen, two game play screens and a final screen. She was able to complete a basic game where a rabbit uses buttons to move the rabbit towards a starfish. A bump block then has the starfish say you found me, and used messages in both the buttons and when the starfish is found. Then the rabbit finds the starfish hidden in some igloos while being watched by polar bears.

This was a great effort with a lot of independent work. I suggested adding instructions for the user as to how to use the game and transitions between the screens, and she worked on that.

The other student combined a story and a game. The main story is about a horse and man. The horse kicks away a rabbit and then challenges the man to a game to see who can find an apple first. At this point the game begins. The horse finds the apple first and wins a soccer ball. This was a great combination. The game came with a working set of buttons to move the horse and the man. It was a good use of say blocks, message blocks, scene change blocks, mostly done independently without much assistance. I helped with some of the logic, so that the horse announces he is the winner AFTER he gets the apple, not before.

  : This week kids continued and finished work on the beach game/candy hunt project. 
  
Some kids started with setting up the main hero's movement, wither with move blocks or change blocks.

Some moved on to getting the program to sense when the candy is found.
