### Message Mania Part 1

Watch the video. 

Question: Something is wrong on the second screen. How do I change the two cats?

#### June 1st UPDATE
I could see that some kids were struggling with this so I called in the Big Dogs. Here is a video showing what to do. If you have any questions, let me know.

### May 25th Homework

* Work on HW I gave you in class (if I did). 
* Continue adding to Message Mania.
* Send me your Message Mania project. 
* Download and install MY SAMPLE Message Mania. Try to understand it and we will work on it next week.

If you don't know what to do, just PLAY with ScratchJr. There is no correct answer! It's all good! 

Ideas: 

* Turn Message mania into a story. What happens next? What is the situation? What is the goal?
* Think about characters/actions you want first. Then code it.
* Send messages to more than one character at a time. Why would you do this?
* Use different color messages to control sequence of events. One character orange. Then red, etc.

### Also Coming Up on June 1st

Do you know the story of the 3 little pigs? If not, try to read it.



We ran through the Message Mania HW assignment.  The purpose of the HW was to:

* Plan/think about the story before you code it. That is why the assignment was NOT to do it in ScratchJr.

My explanation was poor. I blame Zoom ;-) 

Many children did this: 

* One character has: Green flag, orange message, red message, yellow message.

![Green Flag 3 Messages](./images/2020-05-25/GreenFlag3Messages.jpg){: height="100px"}

What I wanted was:

* Each character has a green flag. No message. Messages will be sent by Buttons.
* Each character receives 3 messages
* Each reactions is a different type

The purpose of the project was:

* to show that messages can go to more than one character at a time. 
* to continue getting practice coding messages and buttons.
* Clicking a button can make several characters move at once.
* Help some students use Messages instead of Wait buttons to control sequence and timing. 

I will post a samole project here later in the week.



### Message Mania Part 2

Messages can happen one after the other, such as this common code:

* One character has: Green flag, orange message, red message, yellow message.
* Each message go to one character. Tick does the orange. Tac does the red. Cat does the yellow.

Messages also happen like this.

* Every character has their own green flag.
* Messages are sent to more than one character. 
* Message Mania was many of this pattern happening all at the same time. 



I didn't get to explaining this to students (Zoom is tough), but we'll work on it again in person.



* The character gets the message, and sends another color message to a different character.
* That character sends the next message.
