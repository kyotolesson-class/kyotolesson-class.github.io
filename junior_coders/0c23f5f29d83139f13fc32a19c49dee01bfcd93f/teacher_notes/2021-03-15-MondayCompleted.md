### Homework due March 22nd

Individually assigned.

### Recap for March 15th

Today was quiz day. I made a general quiz that involved making a **Me Super ninja Jump Heart Ninja Dinosaur Volcano** (they chose the name) project together.

Kids took turn answering questions. Questions were easy or hard, depending on the individual level. In addition to reviewing simple concepts like hiding, the questions were aimed at making them think, or leading them towards new concepts, such as shortcuts for adding backgrounds and using **point in direction** blocks.

The final challenge was to make the Ninja jump over a tree. Because this game didn't have the platformer module installed, they had to figure out how to make the character jump directly, which was new for some kids used to **jump** blocks. 


It was fun to see the kids get very excited when they suddenly had an insight or figured out the answer. We will probably revisit this project soon but here it is in its unfinished state. Press right arrow or up arrow to move, and "j" to jump over the tree.
