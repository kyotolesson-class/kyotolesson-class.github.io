### Recap for March 9th

Today students were very creative in coming up with their own ideas and solutions to problems. This is an important step in avoiding getting stuck or frustrated.

Beach Project
  : Continuing from last week, one student came up with what do when the good candy was found. Her idea which was for two of the good candies have all the bad candies disappear. This helped her learn how to use messages and how to broadcast a message and how to hide AKA disappear a character. Another child worked on making hearts appear. To get the hearts to disappear again after a few seconds she had to learn about screen coordinates.


Undocumented Tynker "bug": The bad guy that would not die
  : Another student's Tynker project had a bad guy that would not die. He would reappear even though he was programmed to have only one life. The solution turned out, in an undocumented "feature" that the properties block needs to be part of the same block that has the run and set up character block. Once we fixed this, the program worked!
  
ScratchJr. Chicken Crossing beginning steps
  : Some beginner students are interested in doing the chicken crossing project that some more advanced students are doing. Lat week they had made interesting houses and characters for the project. This week, we worked on teaching them how to make characters the right size and run across the screen in different ways using the movement blocks. We also  how to use an infinite loop how to use a bump block and a touch block to start the chicken moving. The kids also worked on their own exploring various blocks.

ScratchJr. Chicken Crossing advanced steps
  : A more advanced student worked very hard on an alternate version of the chicken crossing game. The goal this time was to make the roads diagonal. After the basic idea (parallel code blocks) was explained, this student was able to create this project all by himself which was quite an achievement. One problem was making the characters move across the screen because the screen is not square. We didn't quite solve this problem, but we explored alternatives.
  
Tynker: Using a loop to change the size of a character
  : another pupil working on Tynker had a question about how to make a character get larger. We used a loop to change the size of the character and a wait block to make the animation effect visible. In the end, though, she decided to just have the character get larger in one big jump.

Usseewa Day! (In case you have been living under a rock in Japan for the past few months, Usseewa is an extremely popular "pop" song by the singer Ado.) The kids in this class are obsessed with it (for this week), so today's project was to use the song in a project. The first step was to record the song using ScratchJr. and this led to a great exercise in cooperation, planning, timing, attention to detail, and other skills related to coding.

For example, this was the work flow we developed:

1. Cue up the song at the start time.
2. Run through the song to determine timing of the next endpoint. ScratchJr. can only record 30 seconds at at time, so we have to choose an endpoint near the 30 second mark. 
3. Choose the endpoint.
4. Get everyone in position to record.
5. Call for silence.
6. The countdown was 3, 2, 1, press record, wait 1 beat, start music.
7. When the music reached the endpoint, students have to press the stop record button the right time. I also tried to stop the song at that time.

We had to go through this steps several times as sometimes the recording didn't work, but we were able to get through 5 iterations.

We also used the internet to take pictures from the song video to use as characters in the project. The kids then started working on their project.

All in all the kids were very focused and motivated this week. I think they need to work a little more on developing the projects next week.

Today we had 2 kids attending via Zoom. I gave kids feedback on their projects from last week and made suggestions for further steps. 2 of the kids took me up on this, and 2 started new projects.

Dance Party
  : For the dance party he added face movement when the character was speaking, and keys to press to adjust  while they speak and he began work on adding instruction screens.

Three Little Codeys
  : She was prompted to come up with a story to go with her project. Her story involved 3 little pigs (aka Codeys) who meet 3 bad guys. They are scared when they see the bad guys, so we programmed this into the characters. Then she decided to add a new level, and we tried to copy the actors from the first level. For some reason this didn't work, so we merely copied the code, and added the characters by hand. Her homework was to finish telling the story.

Platformer:
One child continued working on his platformer project. He got stuck with a character who disappeared and I helped him locate his current coordinates and make a character show who has been invisible.

Animated Butterfly
  : We began to work on his game, but he decided he wanted to check out Scratch again. We suggested the idea of poriting  a project from Tynker to Scratch. He chose the among us project, and we talked about how to make animation from individual costumes. He made a simple animation for his project.
