Randomized Synthesis Project 1

Kids come up with 3 words. I add more words, enough so each student and I can have 3. Kids take turns removing them from a hat.
W each make a project from them. 

Rules: YOu must include all of the words, and they have to be the most important things in teh project (no hiding). At the end, we will have a ScratchJr. Parade.
