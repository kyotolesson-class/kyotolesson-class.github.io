### Scratch 


Today I gave a basic outline of the scratch website. I explained how to: 

* Find your User ID, Stuff, and mailbox

You can see in the picture below how to get **your profile** page, **your stuff** page, **account settings**, and how to **sign out**. The folder icon (With the orange S) also goes to **your stuff**.

* Find the [Jr. Coders 2020 Monday Class Studio](https://scratch.mit.edu/studios/27394220/) 


On your profile page is a section called "Studios I'm Following". I have  added the  [Jr. Coders Monday studio](https://scratch.mit.edu/studios/27394220/) is where I will occasionally post assignments and other items for the class.

* Go to My Stuff

The **my stuff** page is where your projects and studios are found. You can see buttons (top right) for creating **new projects**, **new studios**.

* Remix, add to studio, favorite, see inside

From project pages you can:

1. Remix: Make your own copy of a project so you can edit it
2. Add a project to a studio, which is a way of collecting projects you like.
3. Favorite: This is another way to collect projects. This also appears on the **your stuff** page. 
4. See inside: This allows you to look at the code inside a project.
5. Run the project: Click one of the green flags.
6. Stop a project: click the red stop sign.

### Sample Projects 
We opened some sample projects. [Slash Knight](https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/419503825/) was especially popular.

Another popular project was the [Colorful Trails Project](https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/10001052/).

Kids made a remix of it, and we did a preliminary review of how to:

* create new backgrounds and characters 
* save our projects and the 
* different blocks 
  
without going into too much detail. 


### Homework:

The homework is to look inside Colorful Trails and think about:

1. How could we make Colorful Trails more interesting? (e.g. make it slower, add music, etc.)
2. How could we add more characters and backgrounds
3. How to make it so if I press "c" it clears the board.

Here is my [example remix](https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/421636996/). Loot at how I:

* changed the costumes to letters to spell out my name
* added music 
* added buttons to stop and go:
