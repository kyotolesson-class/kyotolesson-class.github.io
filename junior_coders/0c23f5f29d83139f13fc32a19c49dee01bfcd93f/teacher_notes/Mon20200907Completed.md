### September 7th Homework and Note to Parents

#### September 7th Homework

1. Make a plan for a project you want to do in Scratch, *On paper* (**NOT IN SCRATCH**) describe:
   1. What is the goal of the game/project? How do you succeed? What are the challenges? What is the story?
   2. What are the actions that players can take using the mouse and keyboard? 
   3. What sprites are there? Who are the actors and what are the objects you need?
   4. What backdrops do you need? What are the settings (places) where things happen?
2. If you want to work in scratch, make improvements to the Colorful Trails Project. Show me what you can do! Do your best to figure out on your own things such as how to:
   1. Add buttons that do things
   2. Add music and sounds
   3. Add additional movements
   4. Add/Change costumes and backdrops.
   5. Create a second screen?
3. There were lots of new ideas last week. It would be a good idea to review (at least the pictures of) what we did in class (below). Can you do everything we covered (see below)? 

#### Note to Parents: Bring a Mouse
Some children struggled using touchpads. I recommend having children **bring a computer mouse** to class.

#### Note to Parents: Install Chrome
Students are using different browsers. To avoid confusion we are wondering, if possible, if parents could **install Chrome** on their child's computer. Here is the [download link](https://support.google.com/chrome/answer/95346). 



### September 7th Class Summary

Today I began with a rough overview of Scratch:

We covered, briefly, how to:
* add a costume to the background and sprites
* save and import a photo.
* make sprites speak
* add music extension
* press a key (`b`) to [change the background](https://i.imgur.com/u2PdPmu.jpg)

* press a key (`s`) to [play sounds](https://i.imgur.com/K0QXkIn.jpg)

### Making Music 
*Note that sounds and music are different for scratch. Sounds are recorded, music is played.*
#### 1. Add Music Extension
To make music using instruments you have to add [music extension](https://i.imgur.com/kUL0vZv.gif)

#### 2. Use the music blocks
Then music blocks appear at the bottom of the block section and you can use them just like the sound blocks:

* remember, the music blocks and the sound blocks are different!!

#### 3. Stopping  and Start
The question "how to make the music stop" came up. One "quick" way to make the music stop is to set volume to zero by [pressing a key](https://i.imgur.com/LkwBOiN.jpg):

This doesn't work too well. To do it properly though is a bit difficult!!!! It requires the "[forever repeat until costume trick](https://i.imgur.com/2FneO4Y.jpg)".

I will explain this in a future class!
