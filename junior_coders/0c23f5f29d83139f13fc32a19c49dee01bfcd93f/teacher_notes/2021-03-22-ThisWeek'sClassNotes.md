### Recap for March 19th

Tynker
  : Students worked on tutorials and continued the Beach Project
  
One student new to Tynker continued doing tutorials. She needed some help understanding loops, and pointing in directions. 
  
Another continued the Beach project. She had originally made the main character test to see if she touched the candies. It turned out that this did not work, probably due to a bug in Tynker, so we came up with a new algorithm (good practice), have the candies test to see if they are touching the main actor.

This worked! Though a bit of a detour, it did give the student lots of practice with getting the blocks and moving them to place, which for this student was very useful. At the end, we decided to make the actor return to the home place if she touches a bad candy, using messages.

ScratchJr.
  : The project of the day was a Mario Type game. The main actor has to jump over blocks that approach from the side of the screen. First we make a loop that moves clouds across the screen, with a wait before they reappear at the other side. We then use this to make the blocks approach the actor. 

First, the student shared a project they had done for homework, based on last week's project.

Then I walked the student through all the steps for the project of the day, and the student made their own version.

### Recap for March 20th

ScratchJr.
  : Today the kids essentially continued making version of their projects from last week and tried to come up with original variations. 
  
  For example, one student make a project representing a short scene from a Mario game.

  Towards the end of the class I also introduced project of the day, a Mario Type game. The main actor has to jump over blocks that approach from the side of the screen. First we make a loop that moves clouds across the screen, with a wait before they reappear at the other side. We then use this to make the blocks approach the actor.

  Some kids were able to make this project, but it will need to be worked on more next week.

Next week: make a variation of the Mario Project, or refine the one we have. Do a group game? More telling a story games. Also, do the dots game for fun.

### Recap for March 22nd

Fun Mastered Project  
  : One student, as in the project we reviewed in the February 22nd class, wanted a door that would open when the actor collected a coin. This time, instead of a coin, he wanted to make it a person. 

The meanies are in a trap, but we want to open the trap when the actor collects the collectable. We use **the set tile at point** block to initialize the stage at start, and then we send a message when the collectable is collected to set the tiles to empty when the character is collected.

Road Crossing
  : This student modified the Chicken Crossing game to make it a Road Crossing game. I challenged her to make the game more different/interesting by adding a third road. This allowed me to show her how to add levels and use the Tynker backpack to move code from one level or project to another.

Gangnam Style
  : Another student was able to finish his project, which involved making a character dance in Gangnam Style. sing animate blocks. He planned out the motions on paper and by looking at the available animations. The class enjoyed an impromptu dance session and learning what Gangnam meant from a student of Korean descent.

Working at home
  : Another student demonstrated projects he had finished at home recently. He really has been able to learn a lot just by exploring on his own, and was delighted to share his discoveries with me and the other students. One important discovery for him was that you can copy all the code from one actor, like a stock actor, to your own actor to make them behave the same. He had a lot of fun switching characters to give them unexpected behavior.


:star2: 1. Zonbi
  : The first project was inspired by another student's Zombie game. The Zombie is a modified stock villain. I showed him how to add levels and use the backpack. He then added a top down maze level.

:star2: 2. Torening
  : The student was very proud of his modified stock actors as well as various tile types in this project.

:star2: 3. Rush
  : This project involves multiple heros and using "a" to attack.
