Tutorials
  : Some students are still working on tutorials. Using loops is still challenging, so we worked together on that. 


Walking Guy
  : One student discovered how to make a basic Platformer game and explored making different characters/

Peep Nature Walk
  : A student came up with a story about going shopping Peep Nature Walk. Today she worked mostly on deciding the layouts and actors and she drew a basic background for the store and we ended at the point where we could begin adding this to her project.
