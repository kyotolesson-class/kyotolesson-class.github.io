### July 27th Homework Review 

The Teamwork 5000 Redux homework student made were very interesting and we moved slowly and methodically, so in the end we spent the better part of the entire class giving stars and wishes and debugging. Before running their code, I asked the kids to tell me who their characters were and what happens in each screen to reinforce their project planning and storyboarding. 


### Homework for August 3rd: Flying Project 

I then introduced the Bootup Flying project.

The homework is to imitate (using just the video as a guide) *the first screen*, including 4 animals flying, and touch actions for each of them. You can use your own characters and motions, but keep the basic idea.


* Extra credit: try to figure out how to make the transition from screen 1 to screen 2.
