## Switching costumes

We will show how to switch costumes.

We walk through two ways to make a character change costumes using [this project](./scratchProjects/hidingandreappearing.sjr)

## Using a new screen
If you place the character at the same place in both screens (at the end of one, and the beginning of the other) they will appear toe magically change.

## Using a message
If you send a message that goes to both characters, you can make one disappear, and the other appear at the same time. 

If you add a 3 "smoke screen" that appears and disappears as the characters change, it can seem like magic.

### Diagonal movement

How do you make a character move diagonally across the screen?
How do you change the angle?

#### Screen 1

* How does the rocket get smaller and smaller?
* How does it fly diagonally?
* How does it turn right at the end.

Answer: using synchronized movement and time!

### Hangman

As students worked on the project I demonstrated techniques to solve problems that came up, including a lot of spelling questions. This lead to a rousing game of Hangman.
