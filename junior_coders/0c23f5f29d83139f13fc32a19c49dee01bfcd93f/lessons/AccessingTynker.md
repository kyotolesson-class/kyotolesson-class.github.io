## How to access the Tynker class and Homeworks

* These two links are where you can find homework projects. Sometimes they appear here:

>   * [classroom page](https://www.tynker.com/dashboard/student/#/my-classes/) 

Sometimes they appear here:
>   * [completed projects page](https://www.tynker.com/dashboard/student/#panelCompleted).


Get there by clicking the links. You may also have to login first, or click "Friday and Monday Tynker Class" as you see below.

The homework is in the red circled area at the right (Ping Pong). Also notice the Stream button (blue note) and Completed Projects (green note). "Stream" means chat messages within projects. "Completed" really means "started or finished." 

The homework will be at the *bottom*, in **Next Up for You** (<span style="color: red;">red circled parts</span>) or **Completed Projects** (<span style="color: lime;">click the lime green circled link</span>). 

If you have questions you can send me message from inside the chat/stream window. There is a message about the homework there too. Start by clicking the small black and white Stream button at the *top right* of the picture (<span style="color: blue;">follow the blue arrow</span>). 

Another way to get to the **Assignment Links** is by clicking the "Stream" button on the Dashboard. Watch this video.

The steps are:

* Click Stream
* Click Monday and Friday Tynker Class
* Choose either Assignments or Groups 

Groups means chats inside projects (from the teacher or other students). Assignments means announcements about new assignments.

To create a chat inside a project, click the small  grey square next to your user name. Click the blue/green Share button in the Stream to start the Chat. Post a message at the bottom.

I will automatically be able to see the Chat then. You can also add other students to the chat.

If students have questions about the project, they can ask me directly right there.
