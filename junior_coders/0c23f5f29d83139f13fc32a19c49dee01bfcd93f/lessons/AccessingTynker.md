> * Maybe these direct links work. I am not sure.
>   * [classroom page](https://www.tynker.com/dashboard/student/#/my-classes/) 
>   * [completed projects page](https://www.tynker.com/dashboard/student/#panelCompleted).

The homework is in the red circled area at the right (Ping Pong). Also notice the Stream button (blue note) and Completed Projects (green note). "Stream" means chat messages within projects. "Completed" really means "started or finished." 
 

This shows you how to get to a **project chat** from "Stream".

If it is a new Chat, you have to click the blue Share button in the Stream to start the Chat.

I will automatically be able to see the Chat then. 

If students have questions about the project, they can ask me directly right there.
