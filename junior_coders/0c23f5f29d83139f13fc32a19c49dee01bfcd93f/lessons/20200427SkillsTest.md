## Review of Elementary Skills:

This is a review, not a test. Kids can check the answer if they have questions.

Each answer may be a little different. That is okay.

Below are the steps. Some small steps may be missing. THINK!


- [ ] Choosing and changing the background

  - [ ] Open a new project and choose the outerspace background
  - [ ] Choose to edit it.

- [ ] adding and changing lines and shapes

  - [ ] Choose the circle
  - [ ] Choose a thick line and blue color
  - [ ] Make a second moon
  - [ ] Fill the moon a darker blue

- [ ] Adding and deleting characters
  - [ ] Add a **blank character** and edit him.
  - [ ] Draw an Alien any way you like
  - [ ] extra: add your own picture
  - [ ] Move the character below the moon
  - [ ] Delete the Cat


- [ ] making characters act at the start, or when they are touched

  - [ ] Add a **start trigger** to the Alien
  - [ ] Add a **touch trigger** to the Alien

- [ ] making characters bigger or smaller

  - [ ] Make the Alien normal size when he Starts
  - [ ] Make the Alien get bigger if you touch him


- [ ] making characters move in different ways

  - [ ] Make the Alien move after he starts. Where should he go? Be creative. What should he say? What should he do.

- [ ] making characters visible or invisible

  - [ ] Add a second character. Make her small and put her somewhere.
  - [ ] Add a start trigger and make the character visible when you start
  - [ ] Add a bump  trigger and make the character invisible for 3 seconds then reappear if she is bumped


- [ ] making characters speak and make sounds

  - [ ] Make each character introduce themselves in a **speech bubble** when the program starts
  - [ ] Record an introduction for each character and add the sound at the beginning too.
    - [ ] (extra challenge: can you make them take turns?)
  - [ ] Record a sound and make the second character say something before he disappears if he is bumped

- [ ] sending and receiving messages

  - [ ] Place the 2nd character in the path of the alien (in other words, make sure the alien moves to hit her when she moves). If the alien is bumped, have her say "excuse me" and send a message to the 3rd character
  - [ ] Have the other character say "no problem" in reply and move away 3 steps in any direction

- [ ] moving to different screens/pages

  - [ ] Add another screen and return to the 1st screen.
  - [ ] Add another character. This character changes screens.

  - [ ] At the start, have the character say "Touch me to go to next screen"
  - [ ] If you touch the character, make the project go to another screen
