## Collect-a-card Coding Game
  
The purpose of the game is to get kids to demonstrate their understanding of various steps in coding a simple project. The format is as follows:

1. Review the target project code. This is not a test, but a game, so kids are taught the code or other answers beforehand. The game is for review.
2. Each student gets 1 or two cards to start with.
3. The teacher opens a blank game, or a game ready to accept the target code. 
4. The teacher walks through coding the game and stops to ask questions, such as what is the next step, what does this block do, etc.
5. Students can volunteer to answer by raising their hand with a card in it. If they answer the question correctly they get 2 cards. If not, 1 card.
6. The teacher can also "volunteer" students, for example if no one answers. You get 1 card for a correct answer.
7. Volunteers must wait out 2 turns give others a chance.
8.  Cards for right answers only, but no penalty for a wrong answer.
9.  At the end, (an unspecified number of) cards gets rewards, such as YouTube time. The number is based on the collective level of input. 
10. Those who were volunteered can ask for help but costs them their card. The card for a correct answer goes to person who helps.
11. Top volunteers may get an additional prize based on effort, original contribution, or other criteria.
12. Prizes include in-class YouTube time, select from the toy box, candy, or negotiable prizes. Often students will defer getting any prize.
