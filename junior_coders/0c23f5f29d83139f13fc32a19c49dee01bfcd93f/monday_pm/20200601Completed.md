### Message Mania Part 1

We watched the video about [Message Mania Part 1](#update-to-message-mania-part-1){: .innerlink}

### May 25th Homework Review

We reviewed the homework assignments the kids submitted. They were great and kids enjoy talking about their projects with the class. Kids worked together to fix some problems.

### 3 Little Pigs in ScratchJr

Some kids told their own version of the 3 Little Pigs. The assignment was to plan, on paper, without using ScratchJr, how they would tell the story. This included:

+ Designing the characters and houses
+ Plotting out the actions
+ Writing dialogue

The purpose was to think about the project before actually starting to code it. I reviewed their plans, and when they were ready they started coding. Here is my example of what my plan and first screen look like. 

1. There were three little pigs.
   1. One pig goes to the center and introduces themselves
        1. Draw each pig a little differently
        2. Each pig says something different: name, why my house is good, ?
   2. They become small
   3. The pig then goes to their house
   4. They ask/tell the house they are going inã€€
   5. The house lets them . How would you show that????
   6. The next pig goes and does the same

I had some technical difficulties with my computer but in the end I was able to show them my example project (to be posted later). At this point they had pretty much all begun their own work and didn't need the sample.

### June 1st homework

The homework is:

a. Complete and submit their final project to me.
b. (**DO NOT USE SCRATCHJR. PLANNING ONLY.**) Think about other stories you might want to tell in scratch. Be ready to tell the story in class!
