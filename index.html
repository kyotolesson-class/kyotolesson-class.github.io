          Learning to code has been one of the most fulfilling achievements of my life.<br><br>
          
          Several years ago, I taught myself Python as a way to automate repetitive tasks at a desk job. In 2019, I moved to Kyoto and attended an adult web development bootcamp,
          which, incidentally, was in the same building as Kyoto Lesson! After this, I taught students in subsequent classes and found
          this experience incredibly fun.<br><br>
          
          In my career, I've explored the tech scene in Silicon Valley and built movie props in LA.
          Now I find myself at a startup in Kyoto, contributing to the company's web projects and coaching the CEO on his English. I enjoy working with diverse groups of people and
          giving them the tools they need to succeed. At Kyoto Lesson, I aim to share my hunger for learning and taking on new challenges.<br><br>

          I have worked with children for over 30 years and especially focus on fostering children's
          creativity and sense of play. I also have experience in computer science and several other
          science-related fields. I've started coding at the age of 10, and I was part of the first
          generation of "computer whiz kids".<br><br>

          My work with kids has included afterschool teacher, camp counselor, and kindergarten teacher in
          both U.S. and Japan. My experience with computers includes applications in cobol, html,
          javascript, among others. I am also active as staff for a scientific society in Japan.<br><br>

          I was born and grew up in Europe, but moved to the U.S. when I was 7.
          I speak French, Portuguese and American Sign Language, and basic Japanese.
          I live with my wife and daughter in Kyoto.<br><br>

          I've always had a PC in my hands, being a fan of "MacGyver" and video games, I started to tinker at a very
          early
          age.
          Study wise, I wanted well-rounded skills and I've thus studied IT hardware, System administrator, Network and
          Telecom.
          I've finally specialized in web development and web security and my hobby is to look for websites'
          vulnerabilities
          (I'm a Bug Bounty Hunter !!!).<br><br>

          Early on, I've discovered that I had a passion for teaching and I thus started to teach English to young
          children.
          After a while, I've realized that rather than just teaching English, I should teach something useful in
          English
          and that's what brought me to teach coding and in particular web applications.<br><br>

          I grew up in Belgium and moved to Japan in 2018.<br><br>

          I believe that coding is an essential skill that all children should pick up, as early as possible.
          So when we moved to Kyoto with my wife and four kids, one of the first thing I look for was a proper
          coding school for my children. I wanted a school where children would think by themself and learn by doing.
          As I could not find anything satisfying, I decided to take the matter into my own hands and to start a coding
          school.
          And that's how Kyoto Lesson was born. <br><br>
          I am originally from France and studied in the U.S. Before moving to Kyoto, I was working as a trader for over
          15 years in Tokyo, Hong Kong and Singapore.
          During my career in banks, I had to taught myself to code as this allowed me to automate several repeatitive
          tasks I had to do as a trader.
          I've never stopped coding since then.<br>
