        <p>I made something called card picker. There are 52 cards and when you click a card the card flips and reveals a random 52 deck</p>

        <p>I learned many things when making this card picker. One of the new thing I learned was how to make an animation. That was very interesting. </p>
        <p>If I still had time I would've added an image to the cards and have more features and buttons in the card picker.</p>
