## Overall philosophy

Project based approach. 
Students develop projects as a groups.
Students develop projects on their own.
Students are given projects that focus on their particular needs and abilities.
Students are allowed to work at their own pace

In addition we focus on 

* cooperation 
* teamwork
* conversation
* English skills 
* problem solving

Core competencies developed include:

* Basic computer usage, such as keyboard skills, terminology, computer layout, user interfaces.
* Fundamental coding concepts such as loops, variables, messages, programs, functions. Computer science is a rapidly changing field, so in addition to knowing how to use the specific platforms, we also emphasize underlying concepts that have universal or wide-range applicability. 
* Thinking skills such as diligence and concentration, logical thinking, problem solving, and more generally planning, creativity and self-expression
* The relationship between imagination and implementation is a recurring theme. Students learn to create a plan for their projects, which includes going beyond what you know with your imagination and using your intelligence to turn what is possible into what you have imagined. Learning to develop goals, develop a plan to achieve those goals, implementing the plan, evaluating progress, solving problems, and revising and expanding their projects are key steps that students get ample experience with in this program.

* Problem solving 
* Naturally, coding is an ideal platform to develop a variety science and math skills, especially arithmetic, logic, and geometry. Furthermore, Scratch and Tynker include gaming modules that reinforce STEM topics such as physics (for example, world building). In the past few decades computing itself has developed into a core the practice in science, business and beyond. Early familiarity and competency in computing is a fundamental part of almost all aspects of modern education.
* However, and importantly, beyond coding, students in our program are encouraged to grow and develop their own individual interests and personal growth. Computing and coding are tools to help students explore, develop, and share their personal goals and interest, wherever they may lie; the growth of computing in the modern era has become an instrument that has touched and enhanced almost all fields of human endeavor, including history, society, art, music, language, science, and upon which the problems of the future and their solution will likely depend.
* developing and understanding and implementing new approaches.

### Language

* Another core feature of our program is 
* language skills


## Scratch Jr.


Our starting platform is Scratch Jr., which is an award winning software platform that uses visual coding blocks to introduce coding and other skills. 

Quote from the website: [TODO]


It is designed to meet an extensive list of educational criteria, carefully described here. [TODO]

Tynker's list of educational criteria is [here](https://www.tynker.com/school/coding-curriculum/Tynker-Scope-Sequence.pdf)



One of the central features of ScratchJr. is that it is intuitive and easy to learn. Students as young as 5 or 6 can make their first project within minutes. It is a flexible platform, adaptable to students of all ages and abilities. Older kids who are knew to coding can use it to get a quick leg up, while younger kids benefit from the visual approach and instant feedback. Using the modular block system is akin to play. Since projects run quickly, they provide instant feedback which helps students understand and engage with new concepts. While the teacher is there to remove obstacles, provide guidance and encouragement, promote a sense of accomplishment and competency, give structure and reinforce key ideas and concepts, as well as assess progress, the students themselves are empowered to take ownership of their learning by following their own interests and curiosity. 

## Scratch and Tynker

ScratchJr. is specifically designed to feed into a more advance platform called Scratch. Scratch retains the general block coding structure of ScratchJr. but begins to introduce more advance abilities, such as variables, data structures, loops. It serves as a bridge to text based computer languages such as javascript and python. It too is carefully designed to meet specific computer education criteria, but offers a wide range of 

Scratch has an extensive community that allows projects to be shared and copied and learned from. 

Tynker is a expansion of Scratch that includes tools that make it easy for students to create the very same computer games that they are used to. Using the block, in a few easy steps students can make their own simple Mario-type game, for example, and yet they now have a vast array of blocks, templates, and techniques to develop the in the way that matches their own style and imagination. This empowers them to create their own games and become active agents in their own education and development. 

In addition, Tynker has a variety of teacher tools that allow us to guide students and track student progress. For example, the chat system allows teachers and students to collaborate on projects and do problem solving in real time. We also use Tynker's unique tutorial platform to create our own custom tutorials and homework assignments that students walk through at their own pace. We adapt these tutorials to individual needs, and use them as a way of sharing core ideas with the group. This allows us to incorporate key structural and curricular elements while still allowing students to follow diverse paths.

Critically, Tynker is specifically designed as a bridge to javasript, html, css, and python. It does this in two ways. First of all, while students are creating block style projects, it turns out that a representation of the underlying javascript code for these blocks is available for students who are ready to inspect. Secondly, Tynker has its own javasript, html, css, and python based project platforms. This then allows Tynker to dovetail with our Basic Coding Classes with our more advanced classes as described elsewhere.


Sample Curriculum:

### Setting up the computer
### Using the keyboard and computer
### The scratch jr interface.
### Paint Interface:

### Blocks: 
* Triggering 
* Motion
* Looks
* SOund
* Control Blocks
* End Blocks

For ScratchJr, we begin with projects from bootup and other sources. These are usually modified to suit the group. They might include:

A life story
A day in your life
Telling a Knock Knock Joke
Alien Adventure
Halloween adventure
