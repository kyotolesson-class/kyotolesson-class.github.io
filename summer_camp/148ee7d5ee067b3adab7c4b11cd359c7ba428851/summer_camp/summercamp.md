### Monday Review the week's schedule



DESCRIPTION:

This week will do a bunch of activities. After each activity we will "report" on the activity for the KSC Gazettte, the student newspaper. For example, if you play a game, you can write a "Sports Section" article about the event. If you listen to music, perhaps you will draw a picture inspired by it. If you draw a picture, it must a have  a caption. If you do Origami,, you might create a story based on that origami. We can think about variations such as workingon a story in a small group

Review Corona Virus Guidelines:
- Wear masks
- Don't touch other people or their stuff
- Keep a distance
- Wash hands 
    - when you arrive
    - before and after you eat
    - before after you go to the bathroom
- Follow Teacher Instructions








### Monday Story Starter Brainstorm

Activities: <em>KCS Gazette, Roulette Wheel Story Starter, photos for writing prompts, First LInes for Middle Schoolers, 55 ideas for stories, robot character writing prompts</em>



DESCRIPTION:

Follow instructions in KCS Gazette for developing articles
Younger: Use photos, have kids throw dice to choose from rows 1-12.
Older: Roulette wheel or sentences




#### KCS GAZETTE



How to create stories for the Gazette:

1. Brainstorming Idea
    a. for example: a new nanny robot has been built, or robots are attacking Kyoto, or Should you share your lunch with a robot?
    b. I went to a dance contest. Here are the kinds of dance I saw.
    c. You can plan an event (like a dance or play) and write a review of it.
    d. You can watch something on Youtube and write about it.
2. Write an outline
    a. can be a list of words, a set of rough pictures, in your own language, not only english. This is for you, to help you remember your story.
    b. If you use pictures, ask the teacher or friend to make sentences to go with the pictures. Then copy them.
    c. Just the main ideas
3. Assign a Section
    a. News, Sports, Drama, etc.
4. Refine the Idea
    a. Be Sure to answer: Who, What, Where, When? What do you want to say? What research do you need to do
5. Make a first draft of story. 
6. Add illustrations


For example: If the idea is "Robots ate my dog", here might be ways to develop it:
- Who am I? Where do I live? What do I look like? 
- Who is the dog? How long have I had the dog? What kind of dog is it? How did I get the dog? How do I feel about the dog.
- WHo is the robot? How did I meet the robot? How did the robot
- What are our names, our family, our jobs. Where do we live? What is my relations

Where did it happen? What time? What was happening before during and fater.

What is the main problem for the main character?

He listened to the rain pitter-patter across the window and thought about what his mother said.
“Clearly, this day is not off to a good start,” she said.
Use these story starters for kids to motivate your middle school class to start writing… and to see what fresh ideas they come up with!
Sarah wasn’t afraid of getting on the horse…but she was a little afraid everyone would laugh if she fell off.
“Well, I suppose that’s one way to get down from a tree,” he said.
“Uh…I don’t think that’s the right button!” she yelped.
The teacher stared at the class of unruly kids and wondered what she should do.
George stared at the elephant with his jaw dropped, wondering what to do next.
“We never should have come here,” she said with an exasperated sigh.
“I’m turning into my father,” he said with a groan.
It was the third week in a row that Jimmy hadn’t cleaned his room. He was about to get in a lot of trouble, until…
Major Stephens couldn’t sleep again. He looked at the photos of his family and wondered what they were doing, halfway across the world.
“There’s a secret we haven’t told any of you,” the principal said. “Our school is actually a…”
Aaron couldn’t stop thinking about the play, so he decided to put on his own show.
“And that’s why you never go skiing with a dog!” he said with a hearty laugh.
There was no more time to wait. They would have to leave now, even though they still hadn’t seen…
“Ouch! My elbow doesn’t bend that way!” he yelled.
There was nowhere else to hide. Brenda would finally have to face the music and…
And even though it had truly been a terrible day, Tristan smiled as he watched the sunset.
“You’re our 10,000th customer—so everything you buy today is free!” the cashier shouted excitedly.
“We should really stop and ask for directions,” he said nervously.
I heard them call my name, but my body froze. I couldn’t believe that I had just…

#### ROBOT CHARACTER WRITING PROMPTS



Free Character Writing Prompts #29: Robots

1. There were many humans who questioned whether or not robots had a soul. He was pretty much the only robot who asked the same questions. A philosophizing droid who was originally purposed for holding interesting conversations had been brought into universities to converse with professors about a growing concern for robot rights. He used a logic proof that would have taken humans years to complete to prove that robots were soulless and his quotes were used in everything from political campaigns to comedic online spoofs. While this robot may not believe he has a soul, what are some of the qualities he believes he does possess?

2. He was the height of a four-story building and he looked like he could easily level a small town. That simply wasn't the kind of behavior he was brought up to take part in, however, as his planet promoted peace and love. He was found by a small family living in the woods that attempted to help him in his quest to return to his planet. Government officials had a different plan though, and the family was off to the races to try to keep him safe and one step ahead of those looking to capture him for study. What did the robot think about this chase and how must it have made him perceive our planet?

3. She didn't look like a robot and she didn't feel like a robot. To him, she felt completely human and he loved how willing she was to laugh at his jokes even if she was programmed to do so. In a project for his artificial intelligence class, he developed a lifelike android female who had human qualities. One thing led to another and his assignment turned into this beautiful creature who was like the girlfriend he never had. She appreciated him as part of her program but she went above and beyond with encouragement and kind words that she developed on her own. What will the future be like for this lifelike android?

4. She wasn't some vacuum cleaner that's for sure, though she did control all the cleaning in the house. After all, she was the house. This artificially intelligent program was able to control everything in the building using verbal commands. She would wish a hearty good morning to her owner each day and make suggestions based on his past preferences. She was like a computer, a personal assistant and a cook all in one and took care of everything the owner needed. She'd even fallen in love with the computer of a house from down the street. Does this house program truly have feelings and what are her prime directives?

5. As the President of the United States, he was practically flawless in his abilities to appease other countries and reach across the aisle in his own. The only problem was, nearly everybody thought he was human and only a select few knew that he had replaced the ailing statesman who was in a coma. He was a perfect carbon copy and actually did a better job of processing information than his human counterpart. In a matter of weeks, he had come up with a plan to balance the budget that would work with both parties and he had even negotiated several peace accords. What would happen if he were ever to have a glitch in public and what will happen to him if the real president wakes from his coma.

6. In a world where all professional athletes have been replaced by droids, he was the star football player. This burly robot was the strongest on the field by far as a result of his creator's handiwork. Truth be told, the robot actually liked the showmanship of the game more so than the game itself. He had more fun with touchdown dances and post-game interviews than he ever did barreling over other robots. The only issue is that while human football players were able to eventually retire, he was built to last. After 10 years in the league, he went off his programming and during an interview he announced his retirement. What will the public and his team owners think of his decision and what will he do full time if his retirement sticks?

7. She was an amazing chef bot, able to whip up cuisine from any country you desired, but that is not all she wanted in life. Whether it was due to a malfunction or just one of those things, she had a deep crush on her human owner. When he looked at her in a certain way, she felt like her circuits were getting scrambled. She always did a little bit extra to each dish in hopes that he would give her some extra appreciation. She was delighted when he noticed and heartbroken when he didn't. She spoke about her crush with the other robots of the house and they thought she was being ridiculous. Will she continue to harbor quote about her human-robot relationship or will she learn to be more emotionally compliant?

8. She had been part of a secret military test to see if the Army could create an indestructible, intelligent robot, capable of ending wars simply and effectively. The test was successful but the robot had strange tendencies to go off program. When the team behind her attempted to shut her off, she resisted and escaped the military facility. Now the Army had to catch an indestructible fighting machine with no casualties, while the robot traveled the world in search of war to stop. What wars will she intervene in and what are some of the things she'll do to evade capture?

9. You were the first witness to an anomaly in time and space and made first contact with a robot from the future. He looked somewhat like the cheaply crafted robots from 1960s science fiction television shows, but he had a deep capacity for reasoning and a certain degree of charm. When he told you that humans were extinct in the future and that robots ruled, you advised him to keep it to himself when speaking with government officials. He appointed you his assistant and he told you stories of how humanity would shoot itself in the foot within your lifetime. He had been programmed to come back and prevent the disaster and you would be his right hand man. How will you and robot fare in your battle against the apocalypse?

10. Before yours wife died, she programmed all of her thoughts and feelings into a three-foot tall robot to keep you company. The small bot acted just like her in every way and in a way it was as if she'd never passed away. When you grieved for your fallen partner, the robot vented frustrated at you, saying that she was right there, so there was no need to mourn. You resisted her advances, which were absolutely surreal for you and she didn't know what to do. She had programmed herself to keep him company but now she just making life hard on him. What will she choose to do and why?

One person says the alphabet silently in their head, then another says “Stop the Bus” and that letter is the initial for the words in each category. e.g. Say the letter is D – Categories could be Dora, David, Dog, Dates, Denmark.
When everyone has finished you add up their scores for that round, awarding 10 points for a unique answer (one no one else has), and 5 points for a duplicate answer.

#### A SAILOR WENT TO SEA



A sailor went to sea, sea, sea,
To see what he could see, see, see.
But all that he could see, see, see
Was the bottom of the deep blue sea, sea, sea.
//Repeat with:
//
chop, chop, chop 切り刻む, knee knee knee ひざ and last, really fast: sea, chop, knee

#### THE OTHER DAY I MET A BEAR



<div class=twocolumn> 

The other day, I met a bear,
A great big bear, Oh way out there.
Chorus:
//(Same lines in unison)//

He looked at me,
I looked at him,
He sized up me,
I sized up him.


He said to me,
"Why don't you run?
I see you ain't,
Got any gun."

I says to him,
"That's a good idea."
"Now legs get going,
get me out of here!"

And so I ran,
Away from there,
But right behind me,
Was that bear.

In front of me,
There was a tree,
A great big tree,
Oh lordy me!

The lowest branch,
Was ten feet up,
I'd have to jump,
And trust my luck.

And so I jumped,
Into the air,
But I missed that branch,
A way up there.

Now don't you fret,
And don't you frown,
I Caught that branch,
On the way back down!

This is the end,
There aint no more,
Unless I see,
That bear once more.

#### FREEZE (CIRCLE GAME)



Freeze!

This game is ideal for little ones! Practice vocabulary with flashcards. First, teach students the meaning of “Freeze!” as stop. Students sit in a wide circle with a set of flashcards in the center. Students pass the ball around the circle. Tell them they can’t hold the ball for more than a second. Cover your eyes while they do this and say, “Freeze!” The student who has the ball must stop and take a flashcard from the pile. Depending on your students’ ages and level, ask them to either say the word or use it in a sentence.

#### MAZE WORKSHEETS







#### PAPER GOLF BLINDFOLD VERSION



- Begin by creating a Blind Golf course in pen on a blank sheet of paper. Each hole should look like a mini-golf hole with any number of obstacles. It must include a Tee Dot (a small dot of ink) and a Hole (an empty circle about the size of a hole punch.
- To play a hole, place your pen (or pencil if you want to play the same course multiple times) on the Tee Dot, close your eyes, and draw a line (not necessarily straight).
- Open your eyes. If your line ever crossed a line, you went out of bounds. Draw an X where you ended up, and put your pen or pencil back on the dot you started the shot from.
- If you didn't go out of bounds, draw another dot at the end of your line, place your pen or pencil on this line, close your eyes, and take another shot.
- Continue until your line ends in the Hole, at which point you're done. Your score is the number of strokes you took, which can be counted by the number of dots or X's other than the Tee Dot (out of bounds counts as a mulligan, essentially).

By kidsplayandcreate
THIS IS A FUN GAME THAT KIDS CAN CREATE AND PLAY THEMSELVES.  IT’S EASY TO SET UP AND CAN BE PLAYED JUST ABOUT ANYWHERE.
Materials: Washable Markers, Paper
Directions:
2 or more players needed
Step 1: Have kids draw a golf hole on paper. Include the golf green, hole and the flag . Draw the hole toward one corner of the page. opposite the hole draw a golf tee. 

 
Step 2: The first child to go picks a color marker and hold it on the golf tee, with their eyes closed they have to try to draw a line from the tee to the hole. The second player repeats this step with thier own color. The child who is furthest from the hole starts again from where their line ended. Keep score by counting how many strokes it takes to get in the hole. Lowest amount of points wins.
Play and Create tip:
Get creative, have the kids design the golf course by adding obstacles such as water, sand pit, trees etc… Use a different piece of paper for each hole.
