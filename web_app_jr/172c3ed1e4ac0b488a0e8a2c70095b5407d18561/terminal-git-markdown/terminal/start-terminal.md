## Discover the terminal

It is the time to discover the terminal and to learn to use it to be able to make simple and commun manipulation.

### Goals

Try to dicover what is the command line that does :
- know where we are?
- list the content from a directory?
- create a directory?
- enter in your directory?
- create a file?
- rename that file?
- delete that file?
- come back to origin directory


if you do not know, it is time to ask your new best friend : Google !
Right, with me, before to ask your neighboor, we asks first Google Sensei !

### Exercices

Before to start your terminal, download a pictures of your best character on your desktop.

**The following have to be done only with the terminal**

#### part 1:

To practice, launch the terminal by pressing CTRL + ALT + T simultaneously.
- Then go to the [Desktop] folder with the command that means "Change Directory".
- check that you are in the Desktop folder with the command which means "Present Working Directory".
- Create a file `file.txt`.
- Open the file in your editor (example if you use Visual Code: `code file.txt`) and write a line of text with the first sentence that comes to your mind at random and save it.
- Created a directory [Octocat].
- Go to the [Octocat] directory and create a `yolo.md` file.
- Open the file and enter your name in it before saving it.
- Creates a second file, still in the same directory, named `readme.md`.
- Write inside a small text that speaks of one or more personal projects that you would like to achieve, either during your training or in your life in general.
- Still in [Octocat], create a new file that you name with your own first-name and with the extension `md`. Inside, write a small text that would answer the question "Why be a learner at kyotoLesson".
- Deletes the file `file.txt`
- Displays the contents of the [Octocat] folder.
- Create the [Skills] directory and create a `success.md` file where you will list all computer skills. It can be a list of programs you know and / or use, languages you know or would like to learn, things you can do (for example, make an animated gif), ...
- Navigate in your folders to find your picture you downloaded earlier.
- Create the directory `kyotoLesson_projects` in which you will put all your development projects during your passage to kyotoLesson.
